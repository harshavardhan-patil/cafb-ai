SECTION 1: CONTEXTUAL OVERVIEW

This Knowledge Base supports LLMs in assisting CAFB partners who report discrepancies in invoices, payment applications, grant allocations, or billing charges. Discrepancies may involve:

- Invoices billed for cancelled orders
- Charges for items already credited or returned
- Delivery fees on grant-covered or free items
- Missing invoices from the portal
- Grants not applying correctly to eligible items
- Duplicate or unrecognized charges on PartnerLink
- Credit memos not reflected accurately

SECTION 2: COMMON BILLING DISCREPANCIES & RESPONSE FLOWS
---

**1. Duplicate Charges or Delivery Mistakes**
- Example: Partner received frozen meals on 11/26, but was charged again on 11/27.
- Steps:
  - Confirm the item was delivered only once.
  - Verify SO number and corresponding invoice.
  - Escalate to finance team to remove duplicate line.
- Resolution: Delivery charge removed; invoice adjusted.

**2. Charges for Cancelled Orders**
- Example: A $675.99 order was canceled but still billed.
- Steps:
  - Request SO number and invoice ID.
  - Check for partial credit or refund status in PartnerLink.
  - Follow up with IT and management for full reversal.
- Resolution: Partial refunds may be shown; ensure fees are also reviewed.

**3. Delivery Fee Disputes on Free or Grant-Funded Orders**
- Example: Partner disputes $75 fee on an all-produce (TEFAP) order.
- Steps:
  - Determine if a grant was applied.
  - Check item eligibility for free delivery.
  - If not eligible, confirm fee stands and explain policy.
- Resolution: Inform partner whether the fee is valid or has been waived.

**4. Payment Reflected but Invoice Unpaid**
- Example: Partner made payment but invoice still shows as open.
- Steps:
  - Confirm payment date and method.
  - Escalate to finance for reconciliation.
  - Cross-check PartnerLink status.
- Resolution: Update backend systems to reflect payment; notify partner.

**5. Missing Invoices from CAFB Portal**
- Example: Partner couldn’t find all FY24 invoices on PartnerLink.
- Steps:
  - Verify if invoices were credit card purchases (these may not appear).
  - Request manual export if needed.
  - Suggest future visibility improvements via IT.
- Resolution: Provide download or PDF summary if possible.

**6. Grant Misallocation or Partial Application**
- Example: Order balance remains due despite full grant expectation.
- Steps:
  - Clarify that only one grant can be applied per line item.
  - Explain how leftover balances work (e.g., $30 grant on $50 item = $20 owed).
  - Offer to switch grant allocation (requires IT ticket).
- Resolution: Adjust grant use; confirm updated invoice reflects zero balance.

**7. Discount Not Applied**
- Example: 50% discount not reflected on grab-and-go boxes.
- Steps:
  - Request SO and invoice number.
  - Confirm eligibility and discount application.
  - Escalate to IT if discount failed at system level.
- Resolution: Credit memo issued or invoice adjusted.

**General Billing Inquiry**  
“Thank you for reaching out. We’re currently reviewing your invoice and will get back to you shortly with clarification.”

**Charge Dispute Acknowledgment**  
“We apologize for any confusion regarding this charge. We’re reviewing the invoice and associated records to determine the correct amount.”

**Duplicate Charge Resolved**  
“Thank you for your patience. The delivery charge has been removed and your invoice will reflect this shortly.”

**Unapplied Payment Clarification**  
“We’ve received your payment. Our billing team is reconciling the payment with your invoice and will update the system shortly.”
