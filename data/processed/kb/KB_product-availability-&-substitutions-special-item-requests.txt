Capital Area Food Bank (CAFB) – Internal LLM Knowledge Base  
Category: Product Availability & Substitutions – Special Item Requests

---
SECTION 1: CONTEXTUAL OVERVIEW
---

This Knowledge Base addresses partner queries related to special item requests, including requests for availability of specific items (e.g., peanut butter, chicken pouches), shelf-stability and expiration information (e.g., best-by dates), item packaging clarification, and general product inquiries.

Partners often seek details about:
- Estimated availability of specific product SKUs
- Best-by dates and shelf life
- Whether items are shelf-stable
- Item photos, packaging format, and unit size
- Inventory appearance in PartnerLink

While CAFB staff can support partners with current product information, it is important to **avoid speculative or inaccurate responses**, especially regarding future availability.

SECTION 2: FAQs AND RESPONSES
---

**Q: When will peanut butter, chicken pouches, or macaroni and cheese be available again?**  
A: “Thank you for your inquiry. We don’t have access to our receiving calendar and cannot confirm restock dates. Please keep an eye on the PartnerLink menu, as it updates regularly with available inventory.”

**Q: Can you ask the Food Procurement team about a specific product?**  
A: “We’ve forwarded your request to our Food Procurement team and will follow up as soon as we receive an update.”

**Q: What is the best-by date or shelf stability of a specific item?**  
A: “We can provide best-by dates for items currently in inventory. For example:
- 100773 – Shelf stable
- 100765 – 02/28/2025
- 100780 – 08/23/2026
If a product does not appear in our system, it may not be in inventory at the moment.”

**Q: Can I get a picture or packaging details for an item?**  
A: “We can request packaging information or images from our inventory team. For instance, item #100751 is bulk packed and comes as one 30lb case—not individually packed.”

**Q: Why is an item not showing up in inventory?**
