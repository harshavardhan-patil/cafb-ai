- **Steps**:  
  1. Confirm address and pallet readiness (e.g., stacked properly).  
  2. Notify the Transportation Team.  
  3. If pickup fails (e.g., inaccessible or disorganized pallets), inform the partner of corrective actions (flat surface, stacked).  
  4. Coordinate a new pickup date based on partner availability.

- **LLM Response Template**:  
  _“Thanks for your pickup request! Could you please confirm the pallets are stacked on a flat, accessible surface? Once ready, we’ll coordinate with our Transportation Team and confirm the next available pickup day.”_
