Capital Area Food Bank (CAFB) - Internal LLM Knowledge Base  
Category: Order Modifications - Late Modification Requests  

---
SECTION 1: CONTEXTUAL OVERVIEW
---

This Knowledge Base outlines procedures for supporting partners who need to modify orders after the standard edit window has closed. This includes changes in delivery date, time, or item quantities.

Late requests are often due to:
- Schedule conflicts
- Missed cutoff window
- Holidays or emergencies
- Capacity issues (e.g., ordered too much)

---
SECTION 2: TYPES OF LATE MODIFICATIONS
---

**1. Delivery Date Changes**
- Request to move order earlier or later
- May not be available if outside 10-business-day scheduling window
- Response:  
  _“We’ve processed your date change to [new date/time]” or “This date is not yet available—please check back tomorrow.”_

**2. Time Slot Changes**
- Shifting a confirmed delivery window (e.g., 8–10 to 12–2)
- Must check CAFB calendar availability
- If slot is full:  
  _“Unfortunately, the requested slot is unavailable. We recommend keeping your current slot or checking again tomorrow.”_

**3. Item Quantity Adjustments**
- Usually to reduce over-ordered items
- Requires SO# and item number  
- TEFAP items may require additional review

---
SECTION 3: RESPONSE TEMPLATES
---

**Reschedule Confirmed**  
“Your order [SO#] has been successfully moved to [date/time].”

**Slot Unavailable Response**  
“Thank you for your request. Due to high demand, we are unable to accommodate the requested change at this time.”

**Calendar Visibility Response**  
“That date is currently beyond our calendar’s 10-day scheduling window. Please follow up tomorrow to secure the date.”

**Quantity Change Acknowledgment**  
“Your item quantity update has been submitted. If changes affect TEFAP items, we’ll follow up with confirmation.”

SECTION 4: LLM BEST PRACTICES
---

✓ Always acknowledge the partner’s urgency politely  
✓ Confirm SO# before processing any request  
✓ If a request is not possible, provide actionable next steps (e.g., try again tomorrow)  
✓ For holidays and high-volume weeks, proactively mention delays
