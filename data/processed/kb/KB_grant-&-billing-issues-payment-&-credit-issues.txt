SECTION 1: CONTEXTUAL OVERVIEW
---

This Knowledge Base helps LLMs assist CAFB partners with issues related to:
- Credit card or invoice payments
- Needing to edit paid orders
- Switching payment methods post-order
- Clarifying payment method restrictions
- General confusion around payment, editing permissions, and credit application

These scenarios often involve time-sensitive edits or confusion around payment workflows.

SECTION 2: COMMON PAYMENT & CREDIT SCENARIOS
---

**Scenario 1: Order Placed with Credit Card – Needs Editing**
- CAFB’s system restricts edits on orders paid by card.
- Steps:
  - Ask for Sales Order (SO) number.
  - Forward request to the Customer Relations team to change payment method from “credit card” to “invoice”.
- Resolution: Once changed to invoice, the partner can edit the order.

**Scenario 2: Mistaken Payment Method**
- Example: Partner accidentally selects credit card but prefers invoice billing.
- Steps:
  - Confirm whether the order has already been processed.
  - If not yet fulfilled, the finance team can switch the payment method.
- Resolution: Payment type updated; partner notified.

**Scenario 3: Need to Apply Credit**
- Credits issued via memo (e.g., due to damaged goods or overcharges).
- Credits must be manually applied or automatically deducted in future invoices.
- LLM Guidance:
  - Refer to PartnerLink for applied credit balance.
  - Escalate if memo isn’t reflected after 3 business days.

SECTION 3: PARTNER COMMUNICATION TEMPLATES
---

**Credit Card Edit Blocked Template**  
“Currently, orders placed with a credit card cannot be edited directly. We can update your payment method to invoice so you can make changes. Would you like us to proceed?”

**Payment Method Update Confirmation**  
“We’ve changed your payment method from credit card to invoice. You should now be able to edit your order in PartnerLink.”

**Credit Application Clarification**  
“Any credits issued will be reflected in your PartnerLink account and can be used on future invoices. If you don’t see a recent credit memo applied, we can follow up with our finance team.”

SECTION 4: LLM INSTRUCTIONS & DO’S/DON’TS
---

✓ Always confirm the Sales Order (SO) number before processing  
✓ Do not assume credit or refunds without confirmation  
✓ Avoid telling partners to cancel and re-order unless they cannot edit at all  
✓ Never guarantee refunds or credit application timelines unless verified  

---
SECTION 5: INTERNAL RESOLUTION PATHWAYS
---

- **Customer Relations**: Can change payment method and provide editing access  
- **Finance/Accounting**: Handles credit application and refunds  
- **PartnerLink**: Used for confirming payment type, editing availability, and checking credit balances  

---
SECTION 6: ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
---

- Payment method changes must happen **before** order fulfillment begins  
- Orders paid via credit card often lock editing due to immediate billing  
- Encourage partners to double-check payment selection before finalizing orders  

---
SECTION 7: PARTNER EDUCATION TIPS
---

- Suggest invoice payment if they anticipate needing to edit orders later  
- Recommend checking “My Orders” tab in PartnerLink for real-time visibility on credit memos  
- Remind them that switching from credit card to invoice requires CAFB staff assistance
