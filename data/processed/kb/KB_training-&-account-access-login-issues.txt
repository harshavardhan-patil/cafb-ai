**Scenario 1: Missing Login Access After SMART Shopper Training**
- **Example**: “I attended the SMART Shopper training but did not receive login credentials.”
- **Possible Causes**:
  - Attendance not officially recorded (e.g., participated as a guest or unregistered attendee)
  - Email filter issues preventing delivery of login info
- **Steps to Resolve**:
  1. Verify if the user was listed as an attendee.
  2. Check if user was an existing contact in NetSuite.
  3. If training was attended informally, confirm participation via trainer or colleague.
  4. If qualified, manually issue PartnerLink (PL) access via NetSuite.
- **Important Note**: An automatic email will be sent from NetSuite titled **“Access to Capital Area Food Bank”**. Ask the partner to check spam/junk folders.

**Scenario 2: Creating Login for a New User**
- **Example**: “I need help creating a login with my account.”
- **Steps**:
  1. Search the partner’s agency contact list in NetSuite.
  2. If the requester is not listed, verify whether they’ve completed SMART Shopper training.
  3. If not trained, provide them with upcoming training session options (date, time, Zoom ID/passcode).
  4. Upon training completion, their agency coordinator or CAFB support can enable access.
- **Best Practice**: Encourage partners to attend **SMART Shopper Training** before requesting login credentials.

**Scenario 3: Account Lockout / Trouble Logging In**
- **Example**: “We are locked out of the CAFB website.”
- **Steps**:
  1. Ask for confirmation of their login credentials and if a password reset was attempted.
  2. Provide instructions to reset the password via PartnerLink.
  3. If login remains inaccessible, escalate to **Customer Relations** or **IT**.
  4. Check if the lockout is related to unverified **Hours of Operation (HOO)**.
- **Resolution**:
  - Once hours are verified or corrected, PartnerLink access is typically restored.

**Scenario 4: Account Access Blocked Due to Distribution Details**
- **Example**: “Our site was mistakenly marked as a distribution location.”
- **Steps**:
  1. Confirm current HOO data in PartnerLink.
  2. Clarify with the partner whether they distribute food.
  3. If incorrectly listed, notify the **Regional Coordinator** to remove from public resource listings.
  4. Once corrected, update system status to allow order placement.
- **Reminder**: Always confirm agency classification to prevent public misrepresentation.

**Q1: I attended SMART Shopper training but never received login access. What do I do?**

A: Log in, go to your agency profile, and under "Hours of Operation", click **"Verify"** if the hours are correct. If changes are needed, click **"Edit"** and submit. Once approved, your account will be re-enabled.

**Q4: I’m not listed as a contact for my agency. Can I still get login credentials?**  
A: You must be listed as a contact and must complete SMART Shopper training. Once confirmed, CAFB staff will add you as an authorized shopper and grant you access.

**Q5: Will I receive an email after account access is granted?**
