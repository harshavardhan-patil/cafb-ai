Capital Area Food Bank (CAFB) - Internal LLM Knowledge Base  
Category: Training & Account Access – Missed Training Sessions  

---
SECTION 1: CONTEXTUAL OVERVIEW
---

This Knowledge Base supports the LLM in helping CAFB partners who missed mandatory or optional trainings, such as:
- Smart Shopping Trainings (required for PartnerLink order access)
- PartnerLink feature trainings (e.g., Hours of Operation updates)
- Reporting protocol or regional distribution updates

Common reasons partners miss sessions:
- Didn’t receive Zoom link
- Were unaware of the session time
- Had scheduling conflicts or confusion about signups
- Attended but weren’t marked as present

CAFB uses Zoom for most virtual training and records attendance manually or via Zoom reports. Training attendance is required to unlock certain platform features.
