Capital Area Food Bank (CAFB) – Internal LLM Knowledge Base   Category: Pickup Scheduling & Rescheduling – New Pickup Requests  --- SECTION 1: CONTEXTUAL OVERVIEW ---  This Knowledge Base supports CAFB partners with creating, adjusting, or canceling pickup and delivery appointments. It includes handling of date/time change requests, pallet pickups, transportation-related challenges, order fulfillment issues, and how system limitations may affect scheduling.  Common partner inquiries: - Rescheduling existing pickup or delivery orders - Changing pickup times within the same day - Moving orders due to agency closures or weather - Requesting empty pallet pickups - Address or contact info corrections for pickups - Clarifying PartnerLink system errors when selecting dates - Asking about combining multiple orders or deliveries  --- SECTION 2: ORDER SCHEDULING GUIDELINES ---  **1. Requesting a New Pickup or Delivery Date** - Date changes must be made at least 3 business days in advance. - Some requests may be denied due to:   - Full capacity on the requested date   - Short notice within the fulfillment window   - Holidays or inclement weather  _Template:_   “Thank you for your request. Unfortunately, we are unable to schedule a pickup for [requested date] due to [reason]. Please let us know if you would like to select an alternative date.”  **2. Pickup Time Adjustments** - Within-day time adjustments (e.g., 8am → 10am) are often possible. - Time slot changes may be subject to availability and warehouse approval.  **3. Pallet Pickups** - Partners can request pickup of empty pallets via ticket. - CAFB aims to notify partners at least 1 day in advance, though same-day pickups may occur. - Partners should provide:   - Approximate number of pallets   - Preferred contact person and number   - Location details (especially if at a shared site or hub)  --- SECTION 3: SYSTEM LIMITATIONS & TROUBLESHOOTING ---  **1. “I Can’t Select My Preferred Date”** - Orders must be placed 3 business days before delivery/pickup. - Holidays (e.g., Memorial Day) or system errors may reduce availability. - Only one order can be active per partner per day.  _Template:_   “If your preferred date isn’t available, it may be due to the 3-business day requirement or a system holiday block. Please try selecting a different date, and we can assist with adjusting it if needed.”  **2. Changing Contact or Address Details** - Partners may submit updated contact or address info through support tickets. - Staff can update these on the backend prior to dispatch.  _Template:_   “We’ve updated the contact info/address for your order. Please confirm all future orders reflect this change in PartnerLink.”  **3. Unable to Combine Orders** - System does not support merging separate orders into a single delivery/pickup. - Encourage partners to plan ahead or stagger orders accordingly.  --- SECTION 4: LLM RESPONSE TEMPLATES ---  **Rescheduling Due to Closure or Weather** “Thank you for the update. We’ve rescheduled your order for [new date and time] as requested. Please check PartnerLink to confirm the change.”  **Same-Day or Late Requests** “Unfortunately, your order is already in the fulfillment stage and cannot be modified. Let us know if we can support rescheduling a future order.”  **Pallet Pickup Confirmations** “We’ve notified the Transportation team and scheduled a pallet pickup for [date and time window]. Please ensure pallets are accessible.”  **Holiday Conflict or Delivery Block** “The date you selected was unavailable due to a holiday or system closure. We’ve updated your order to [new date]. Thank you for your flexibility!”  --- SECTION 5: ESCALATION PATHWAYS ---  - **Customer Relations** – All pickup/reschedule tickets and general support   - **Transportation Team** – For pallet pickups, delivery coordination, and field driver contact   - **Regional Coordinators** – For long-term changes to recurring deliveries or partner info   - **Warehouse Management** – For day-of pickup windows and logistics conflicts    --- SECTION 6: PARTNER BEST PRACTICES ---  ✅ DO: - Submit requests 3+ business days in advance   - Confirm time slot availability in PartnerLink   - Provide contact numbers for onsite coordination   - Notify CAFB of address/contact changes early   - Use specific SO# (Sales Order Number) in requests    ❌ DON’T: - Assume late reschedules will be honored if order is in fulfillment   - Attempt to place multiple orders on same day via PartnerLink   - Leave pallets inaccessible or without instructions    --- SECTION 7: COMMON QUESTIONS & RESPONSES ---  **Q: Can I move my pickup from Tuesday to Thursday?**   A: “We can assist with that! Please confirm your SO# and preferred pickup window.”  **Q: I never received confirmation that my change was accepted.**   A: “Once your ticket is updated, PartnerLink should reflect the new date. If not, please reply with your order number and we’ll verify it manually.”  **Q: Can you combine my two orders for the same week?**   A: “Unfortunately, our system does not support combining multiple orders. Each order will be delivered/picked up on its scheduled day.”  **Q: Can the driver call ahead before a pickup?**   A: “Yes! Please provide a contact number, and we’ll relay the message to our Transportation Team.”  **Q: I placed an order but can’t schedule a pickup for my preferred date.**   A: “Some dates may be blocked due to fulfillment cutoffs or system holidays. We can help move your order backend—just send us the SO# and preferred time slot.”  --- SECTION 8: SPECIAL NOTE ON WEATHER/EMERGENCIES ---  During inclement weather or emergency closures: - Orders may be delayed or rescheduled unilaterally for partner safety. - Updates will be communicated through email and support tickets. - CAFB will prioritize rescheduling and maintain regular communication.  --- SECTION 9: CONTACTS ---  - **Customer Relations** – customerrelations@capitalareafoodbank.org   - **Partner Support** – partnersupport@capitalareafoodbank.org   - **Transportation Team** – coordinated internally; contact via ticket for updates
