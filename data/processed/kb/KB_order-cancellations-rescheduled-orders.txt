Capital Area Food Bank (CAFB) – Internal LLM Knowledge Base  
Category: Order Cancellations & Rescheduled Orders

---
SECTION 1: CONTEXTUAL OVERVIEW
---

This Knowledge Base is built to assist CAFB’s support system in managing partner requests related to cancelling and rescheduling orders. These include proactive cancellations by partners, weather-related service disruptions, inventory issues, and rescheduling due to operational or volunteer constraints. The information herein provides clear, accurate guidance to empower a chatbot to effectively communicate with CAFB partners and escalate when needed.

---
SECTION 2: COMMON SCENARIOS & RESPONSES
---

**1. Partner Requests to Cancel an Order**
- Partners may request order cancellations due to staffing, weather, or operational needs.
- Orders must be cancelled before they lock (generally 3 business days before the scheduled date).
- If locked, cancellations may need manual intervention by CAFB staff.

_Template:_  
“Thank you for your message. We’ve cancelled your order as requested. Please allow an hour for the system to reflect this.”

**2. Rescheduling Due to Inclement Weather or Emergencies**
- CAFB may proactively cancel or postpone orders when safety is a concern.
- Partners can select a new date from available options.
- Orders may be merged or items transferred to minimize disruption.

_Template:_  
“Due to the weather, your order was impacted. We’ve rescheduled it to the next available window on [DATE, TIME]. Please confirm if that works for you.”

**3. Orders Affected by CAFB Holiday or Closure**
- Orders may be rescheduled during bank holidays or snow closures.
- Communication includes options for alternate fulfillment or combining orders.

_Template:_  
“Your order was impacted by our closure. It has been rescheduled to [NEW DATE]. If that does not work for you, we can discuss alternate options.”

**4. Partner Requests to Merge or Modify Orders**
- Partners may want to combine multiple orders to avoid multiple deliveries.
- Requests to add/remove items may require SO numbers and review of fulfillment status.

_Template:_  
“We’ve merged your orders to reduce the delivery burden. Please allow time for the system to update. Let us know if changes are still needed.”

SECTION 3: BEST PRACTICES FOR PARTNERS
---

✅ DO:
- Include Sales Order (SO) numbers in all requests
- Contact support as early as possible (preferably before the order locks)
- Clearly state preferred reschedule dates/times and any constraints
- Confirm weather-related closures proactively

❌ DON’T:
- Edit orders that have been manually changed (e.g., reassigned items)
- Assume cancellation is processed without confirmation
- Rely solely on system auto-messages—reach out if unsure
- Request cancellation after scheduled date without CAFB approval

---

**Q: Can I cancel an order after it’s locked?**  
A: Orders are generally locked 3 business days prior. Cancellation may still be possible with manual override—contact support immediately.

A: Yes, you may cancel and submit a new order, pending inventory and delivery slot availability.

A: CAFB may reschedule orders due to weather, closures, or routing changes. You’ll be notified and can request alternate options.

**Q: Can I reschedule to a specific time window?**  
A: Yes, pending availability. Let us know your preferred delivery window (e.g., 8–10 AM, 10–12 PM, etc.).

**Q: Can I transfer items from a cancelled order to a new one?**

Chatbot: “Yes. I can help cancel your current order, and you may submit a new one with updated items.”
