SECTION 2: COMMON SCENARIOS & RESOLUTION FLOWS
---

**Scenario 1: Request for Hours of Operation Training**
- The Hours of Operation training is available via **Zoom**.
- The Zoom link is typically provided in a **confirmation email** after registration.
- Partners can view or update their listed hours in PartnerLink by navigating to their **Account Overview** > **Additional Information** > **Hours of Operations**.
- To verify hours: click **"Verify"** if accurate, or **"Edit"** to update them.
- Screenshots may be included in training materials for guidance, but these are examples and may not reflect the partner’s actual data.

**Scenario 2: Updating Hours of Operation**
- Location: PartnerLink under Account Overview.
- Instructions:
  1. Log in to PartnerLink.
  2. Click your agency name to access Account Overview.
  3. Under "Additional Information", click **Hours of Operations**.
  4. Click **Edit** to update hours and submit for approval.
- Approval is completed by the **Regional Coordinator**.

**Scenario 3: Requests for Smart Shopping Class Access**
- Classes are held on Zoom, and upcoming sessions are shared in communication from the **Maryland Partnership Coordinator**.
- If the provided training time does not work, partners may reach out to Partner Support to coordinate an alternative.
- When changing points of contact, new staff must attend Smart Shopping training to gain online ordering access.

**Scenario 4: Request for Support on Senior or Children’s Meals**
- For **children’s meal support**, refer to:  
  **Lexie Smith**, Youth Nutrition Coordinator for MD  
- For **senior meal programs**, refer to:  
  **Cecilia Chisholm**, Coordinator of Senior Hunger Programs  
- Direct contact emails are not stored in the KB but should be shared in response via templates or directory.

**Scenario 5: Questions Regarding Expired Food Items**
- CAFB recommends using the **Food Coding Guide** as a reference.
- For items not listed (e.g., snack items like Oreos), partners should consult external sources such as the **USDA website**.
- Sensory inspection (smell, sight, texture) is encouraged when the expiration date has passed but the item is sealed and undamaged.
- If the food was not supplied by CAFB, the guidance is more limited but general food safety standards should apply.
