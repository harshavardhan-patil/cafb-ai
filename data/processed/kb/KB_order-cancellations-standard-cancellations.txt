**Capital Area Food Bank (CAFB) - Internal LLM Knowledge Base**  
**Category: Standard Order Cancellations**

---

### SECTION 1: CONTEXTUAL OVERVIEW

This Knowledge Base equips the LLM to assist CAFB partners in managing **standard order cancellations** that do not fall under urgent, last-minute, or emergency categories. These typically involve requests made well in advance of the scheduled delivery date and within the standard editing window provided in PartnerLink.

Standard cancellations often happen due to:
- Schedule changes
- Volunteer shortages
- Facility conflicts
- Over-ordering

This KB also distinguishes standard cancellation procedures from urgent requests or system-locked cancellations.

### SECTION 2: ORDER CANCELLATION WINDOW

- **Orders may be canceled directly by partners via PartnerLink** up to **3 business days before delivery**.
- After this window, orders are **locked** and require internal assistance for manual cancellation.
- If cancellation is requested **after lockout but not within 24 hours**, it's considered a **manual (non-urgent) cancellation** and should be escalated internally.

---

### SECTION 3: CANCELLATION FLOW FOR LLM

1. **Acknowledge Request**  
   “Thanks for reaching out. I can help you cancel that order—could you please confirm the Sales Order (SO) number?”

2. **Check Eligibility**  
   - Ask the partner if the cancellation is due to schedule, weather, or resource issues.
   - Check the order date to ensure it is **not locked**.
   - If the request falls outside of the PartnerLink cancellation window, flag for internal review.

3. **Process or Escalate**  
   - If within the allowed timeframe: confirm cancellation and remind the partner they can reorder if needed.
   - If outside of the cancellation window (but not urgent): note that internal teams will process the request and follow up.

4. **Confirm Outcome**  
   “Your order SO[XXXXXXX] has been canceled. You should see the change reflected in PartnerLink shortly.”

### SECTION 4: RESPONSE TEMPLATES

**Standard Cancellation (Pre-Lock Window)**  
“Your order has been canceled per your request. If you’d like to submit a new one, you can do so through PartnerLink.”

**Manual Cancellation Needed (Post-Lock, Not Urgent)**  
“Your order is currently locked in the system, but I’ve submitted a request to our internal team to cancel it manually. We’ll follow up once confirmed.”

**Partner Requests Reorder After Cancellation**  
“You can submit a new order at your convenience through PartnerLink. Let me know if you'd like help with the process!”

**Unable to Cancel (Too Late)**  
“Unfortunately, the cancellation window has passed. If you're unable to receive the delivery, we recommend contacting our team directly at [partner support contact].”

### SECTION 5: BEST PRACTICES & LLM GUIDELINES

✅ Always:
- Confirm the SO number before processing
- Distinguish between “standard” and “urgent” cancellations
- Let the partner know if the order is locked
- Encourage early communication, especially for high-volume or specialty orders

❌ Never:
- Assume the cancellation is successful without system or staff confirmation
- Cancel orders without verifying partner identity and SO number
- Offer fixed reschedule windows unless confirmed by internal teams

### SECTION 6: FAQS

**Q: When can a partner cancel an order themselves?**  
A: Up to 3 business days before delivery via PartnerLink.

**Q: What if the order is locked but still needs to be canceled?**  
A: The LLM should escalate this for manual intervention. Include the SO number and partner agency name.

**Q: Can a partner cancel and then reorder?**  
A: Yes, as long as the new order fits within the inventory and schedule availability.

**Q: Can items from a canceled order be transferred to a new one?**  
A: Possibly. This depends on inventory availability and internal processing. Refer to the Food Resourcing or Operations Team for confirmation.
