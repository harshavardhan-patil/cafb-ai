Capital Area Food Bank (CAFB) – Internal LLM Knowledge Base  
Category: Order Modifications – Item Removals

---
SECTION 1: CONTEXTUAL OVERVIEW
---

This Knowledge Base helps the LLM support partners who need to remove items from orders. Common reasons include overstocking, space constraints, changing client needs, produce limits, or receiving contaminated/expired/damaged goods. In some cases, item removals are triggered by CAFB’s Operations team due to shortages, quality control issues, or TEFAP eligibility updates.

This KB includes handling of locked orders, special considerations for produce and TEFAP items, communication templates, and escalation workflows.

SECTION 2: COMMON SCENARIOS & RESPONSES
---

**1. Partner Requests to Remove Items Before Order Locks**
- Requests must be made at least 3 business days before delivery/pickup.
- Include SO number and specific item codes or descriptions.

_Template:_  
“Thanks for your request! I’ve removed the specified items from your order. Please allow some time for the system to reflect these changes.”

**2. Order Is Locked – Item Cannot Be Removed**
- If an order is already staged or pulled, items cannot be removed.
- Delivery team may be able to return items if partner declines delivery (with proper notice).

_Template:_  
“Your order is locked and in fulfillment. If you’re unable to accept a specific item, let the driver know or contact us to schedule a return.”

**3. Emergency or Health-Related Item Removal (e.g. pest contamination)**
- Items posing health risks should be reported with documentation (photos, timeline).
- CAFB may remove items from inventory and investigate warehouse sanitation.

_Template:_  
“We’re very sorry to hear about this. Thank you for sharing your experience and photos. We’ve escalated this to Operations and scheduled a facility inspection. We’ll be in touch regarding compensation or next steps.”

**4. TEFAP Status Changes (e.g. partner becomes ineligible)**
- TEFAP items must be removed from affected SOs.
- CAFB must cancel orders containing ineligible TEFAP items.

_Template:_  
“Since your agency is currently ineligible for TEFAP items, we’ve removed those items from your order. Please let us know if you'd like help adding non-TEFAP alternatives.”

**5. CAFB-Initiated Removals (e.g. out of stock, fulfillment issue)**
- Items may be removed during staging if inventory changes or errors arise.
- Notification emails explain the issue and offer alternatives if available.

_Template:_  
“Unfortunately, item [XXXXXX] was removed due to low inventory or a warehouse error. We understand this is disruptive and are happy to explore alternative options.”

SECTION 3: PARTNER BEST PRACTICES
---

✅ DO:
- Submit removal requests before the 3-business-day lock window  
- Reference item codes and SO numbers  
- Communicate specific concerns (e.g. contamination, space limits)  
- Notify CAFB immediately if issues arise after delivery  

❌ DON’T:
- Wait until delivery day to request removals unless it’s an emergency  
- Accept delivery of items you plan to discard—coordinate return if possible  
- Expect credits or returns without photographic documentation when needed

SECTION 4: FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
---

**Q: Can I remove items from my order once it’s submitted?**  
A: Yes, if your order hasn’t been locked yet. We can help you remove items with the correct SO and item info.

**Q: My order was locked early. Why?**  
A: Lock dates are based on business days. Holidays and warehouse blackouts may lead to earlier-than-usual locking.

**Q: An item was removed from my order—why didn’t I know earlier?**  
A: If the item was removed during fulfillment, it’s often due to inventory shortages. CAFB sends automated notifications to alert partners.

**Q: Can I get a refund or credit for items I removed after lock?**  
A: Typically, no. Once orders are staged, items cannot be credited unless they are rejected on delivery for a valid reason (e.g. damage).

**Q: What if my item removal is due to food safety concerns?**  
A: We take those cases very seriously. Please submit photos and details so we can investigate and ensure no other partners are affected.

SECTION 5: CHATBOT RESPONSE EXAMPLES
---

**Partner: “Please remove the turkey from our order.”**  
Chatbot: “Sure! Can you provide the Sales Order number and the item code or name of the turkey so I can submit the removal?”

**Partner: “I tried to remove an item but my order was locked.”**  
Chatbot: “Locked orders are in fulfillment, so edits are limited. If you’re unable to accept the item, let us know and we may be able to schedule a return.”

**Partner: “One of our items came with signs of contamination.”**  
Chatbot: “I’m so sorry to hear that. Please send photos and the SO number, and I’ll escalate this to our Operations and Food Safety teams.”

**Partner: “Why was a TEFAP item removed?”**  
Chatbot: “That may be due to a TEFAP eligibility change. I’ll double-check for you, and we can help find alternatives.”
