SECTION 3: LLM RESPONSE FLOWS BY INQUIRY TYPE
---

**1. “When Will [Item] Be Back?”**  
- If no specific ETA is available, defer to the Food Procurement Team and ask the partner to check PartnerLink regularly.
- If ETA is known, share the approximate restock window (e.g., “by end of the week”).

_Template:_  
“We’ve reached out to our Food Procurement team and expect [item] to be back on the menu by [day]. Please check PartnerLink around that time.”

**2. “Why Does It Show 0 Available?”**  
- CAFB's inventory resets at midnight.
- Popular items may sell out quickly after appearing on the menu.

_Template:_  
“The item may have sold out soon after it was added to the system. Inventory refreshes nightly at midnight. We recommend checking PartnerLink early in the morning.”

**3. “Is This Shelf Stable?”**  
- Confirm with product details if available, especially for RTE (Ready-to-Eat) items.

_Template:_  
“Yes, this item is shelf-stable and does not require refrigeration. RTE stands for Ready-to-Eat.”

**4. “Can I Get [Substitute Item] Instead?”**  
- Substitutions may not be possible unless directed internally.
- Encourage checking for similar products (e.g., other pasta shapes).

**5. “What’s the Expiration or Packaging Type?”**  
- Provide expiration dates and packaging type when requested.
- Offer photos if they are available.

_Template:_  
“The item is packaged in [plastic cups / cans] and has a best-by date of [MM/DD/YYYY].”

---

- **RTE**: Ready to Eat  
- **Shelf-Stable**: Product does not require refrigeration

- **PartnerLink**: Web portal where partners place orders and view availability

---
SECTION 6: INTERNAL ESCALATION PATHWAYS
---

- **Food Procurement Team**: For restock timelines and sourcing updates  
- **Food Resources Team**: For partner item needs and DC ↔ VA warehouse transfers  
- **Customer Relations**: For all front-line communication and troubleshooting  
- **Warehouse Ops**: For availability across distribution locations  

---
SECTION 7: PROACTIVE TIPS FOR PARTNERS
---

- Check PartnerLink early in the morning for best inventory visibility  
- If a critical item is unavailable, ask about alternate forms (e.g., 1% milk instead of whole)  
- Monitor emails from CAFB for menu updates or feature announcements  
- If an item is missing from the menu for an extended time, reach out for direct support  

---
SECTION 8: SPECIAL NOTE ON PRODUCE
---

Produce availability varies based on seasonality, donations, and delivery schedules. Advise partners to:
- Check early in the week
- Act fast, as produce is high-demand
- Use “Office Hours” or ticketing if they serve high-volume events (300+ families)
