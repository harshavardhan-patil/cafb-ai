Capital Area Food Bank (CAFB) - Internal LLM Knowledge Base
Category: Delivery Issues - Damaged Goods

---
SECTION 1: CONTEXTUAL OVERVIEW
---

This knowledge base is specifically structured to help the LLM understand and support CAFB partners who are reporting issues related to receiving damaged goods as part of their food deliveries.

“Damaged Goods” include:
- Leaking or dented cans (e.g., peaches, tuna)
- Rotten or moldy fresh produce
- Expired or near-expiry non-perishables (e.g., peanut butter)
- Contaminated packaging (e.g., rodent bite, visible mold)
- Physical damage due to weather, storage, or handling
- Foreign presence (e.g., rodents under pallets)

The CAFB standard resolution processes typically involve credit issuance, item pickups, or internal escalation.

SECTION 2: COMMON SCENARIOS & RESOLUTION FLOWS
---

**Scenario 1: Leaking/Damaged Cans**
- Example: 17 out of 24 cans of peaches were punctured or leaking.
- Steps:
  - Ask user to provide clear photos of affected items.
  - Confirm item details: quantity damaged, item number, and sales order.
  - Submit for credit processing.
- Resolution: Issue Credit Memo (visible on PartnerLink in 2-3 days).

**Scenario 2: Spoiled Produce**
- Example: Moldy tomatoes or squished produce.
- Steps:
  - Ask partner to send clear photos and quantity affected.
  - If unable to dispose: Ask if pickup coordination is needed.
  - If TEFAP-related: Request documentation and photos for state agency compliance.
- Resolution: Transportation team retrieves items if requested; Credit memo possible.

**Scenario 3: Delivered Expired Product**
- Example: Boxes of peanut butter labeled past “Best By” date.
- Key Info: CAFB policy states that food past the “Best By” date may still be safe.
- Steps:
  - Ask partner to refer to CAFB’s Food Coding Guide.
  - Confirm if food is actually expired (not just past best by).
- Resolution: Reassure the partner if food is safe. If unusable, escalate for refund.

**Scenario 4: Contamination (Rodents, Mold, Pests)**
- Example: Masa Harina bag with rodent bite; mold on tuna cans.
- Steps:
  - Confirm presence of contamination.
  - Request sales order, item number, and photos.
- Resolution: Report to leadership and issue partial/full credit as applicable.

**Scenario 5: Weather-Affected or Delayed Delivery**
- Steps:
  - Confirm if rescheduling is possible (e.g., Wednesday availability).
  - Document and coordinate with Transportation Team.
- Resolution: Delivery rescheduled; confirmation sent to partner.

**Scenario 6: Unreported Item Recall**
- CAFB recall policy states affected inventory is removed from menus immediately.
- CAFB informs:
  - DDP partners = CAFB coordinates outreach.
  - Agency partners = Responsible for notifying end-clients.
- Resolution: LLM should mention recall monitoring and that affected partners will be contacted.

SECTION 3: KEY ACTION TEMPLATES FOR LLM RESPONSES
---

**Photo Request Template**
"Could you please upload clear photos of the affected items so we can verify the issue and process the necessary credit or action?"

**Sales Order & Item Info Template**
"Please provide the Sales Order number and item number(s) for the damaged goods. This helps us escalate the issue internally."

**Credit Memo Acknowledgment**
"Thank you for reporting the issue. A credit memo will be issued within 2-3 business days and reflected in your PartnerLink account."

**Food Safety Clarification Template**
"Items past the 'Best By' date are still safe to consume per our Food Coding Guide, unless you observe visible spoilage or damage."

**Pickup Coordination Template**
"If you’re unable to dispose of the damaged items, we can coordinate a pickup during your next scheduled delivery. Would you like to proceed with this?"

SECTION 5: LLM-SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS
---

✓ Always start with empathy and assurance (e.g., “We’re sorry to hear about this and appreciate you bringing it to our attention.”)

✓ Avoid assuming the severity of the issue without photos or item counts — always **request** supporting details.

✓ Do not instruct the partner to dispose of food unless:
  - They indicate they can handle disposal.
  - The product poses a clear health risk (e.g., mold, pests).

✓ For “Best By” or expired food claims, **remind** the partner of CAFB’s Food Coding Policy.

✓ If pickup is needed, **suggest scheduling it with the Transportation Team** and confirm delivery/pickup dates.

✓ Offer to **connect with their regional coordinator** or appropriate CAFB team if needed.

✓ Mark any issue involving rodents, mold, or biohazards as **high priority** internally.

SECTION 6: INTERNAL POLICIES & TOOLS
---

- **Credit Memo Processing**: Typically takes 2–3 business days. Memo IDs like #8311 or #8283 are associated with PartnerLink invoices.

- **Escalation Contacts**:
   - Operations Team (Warehouse-related issues)
   - Transportation Team (pickup/logistics)
   - Food Resourcing Team (menu updates)
   - Customer Relations (case tracking)

- **PartnerLink**: All credits and delivery updates are reflected here.
