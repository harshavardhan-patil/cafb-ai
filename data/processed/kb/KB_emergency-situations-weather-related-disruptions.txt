Capital Area Food Bank (CAFB) – Internal LLM Knowledge Base  
Category: Emergency Situations – Weather-Related Disruptions

---
SECTION 1: CONTEXTUAL OVERVIEW
---

This Knowledge Base outlines CAFB’s protocols for managing inclement weather scenarios and emergency disruptions, such as snowstorms, ice, and dangerous road conditions. It includes cancellation and rescheduling procedures, communication protocols, refund and fee handling, and how partners should prepare for or respond to such events.

This information equips the LLM chatbot to assist CAFB partners with clarity, while prioritizing safety, responsiveness, and transparency.

SECTION 2: COMMON SCENARIOS & RESPONSES
---

**1. Weather Forecast Causes Concern Before a Scheduled Delivery**
- CAFB does not automatically follow government closures.
- Leadership, including Operations, determines delays or closures.
- Notifications are sent out via email or direct contact.
- Delays adjust time slots (e.g., 2-hour delay shifts 8–10 AM to 10–12 PM).

_Template:_  
“We’re actively monitoring the weather. If there’s a delay or closure, we’ll notify you. A 2-hour delay would push your 8–10 AM window to 10–12 PM.”

**2. Order Canceled Due to Weather**
- Orders may be canceled if conditions are unsafe.
- Partners are offered rescheduling opportunities.
- Some return shipping fees may be waived depending on site readiness and decision context.

_Template:_  
“Your order was canceled due to unsafe weather. Let’s reschedule. We’ll coordinate with Transportation and notify you of the new time.”

**3. Partner Asks About Return Fees or Credit for Missed Orders**
- If CAFB cancels due to weather, shipping fees may be waived.
- If the partner was not prepared or didn’t clear the site, fees may still apply.

_Template:_  
“If a weather-related disruption occurs and your site was prepared, we typically waive return fees. If not, the fee may still be applied.”

**4. Policy Clarification Requests**
- Partners may request the Inclement Weather Policy.
- Policy emphasizes decision-making by CAFB leadership—not federal or local closures.

_Template:_  
“Our Inclement Weather Policy is available upon request. We decide internally based on safety, staff conditions, and logistics—not external government closures.”

SECTION 5: CHATBOT RESPONSE EXAMPLES
---

**Partner: “There’s snow in the forecast. Will I still get my delivery?”**  
Chatbot: “We’re watching the weather closely. Our team will notify you if any delay or closure is confirmed. Please ensure your site is clear.”

**Partner: “The snow made our site unsafe. Can I cancel without a fee?”**  
Chatbot: “Thanks for letting us know. If the delivery hasn’t left yet, we can cancel. Return fees depend on site readiness and delivery status.”

**Partner: “What is your snow policy?”**  
Chatbot: “CAFB evaluates conditions independently of government decisions. I can send you the full Inclement Weather Policy if you’d like.”

**Partner: “We were ready, but the order was canceled. Do we get charged?”**  
Chatbot: “If you were ready and CAFB canceled due to weather, we typically waive the shipping or return fee.”
