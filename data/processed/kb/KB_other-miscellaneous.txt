Capital Area Food Bank (CAFB) – Internal LLM Knowledge Base  
Category: Other / Miscellaneous

---
SECTION 1: CONTEXTUAL OVERVIEW
---

This Knowledge Base category serves as a flexible reference for partner concerns that do not fall within standard technical, operational, or delivery categories. It includes topics such as handling sensitive client relations, food safety incidents, product complaints, account access changes, event-specific requests (e.g. Thanksgiving food), and general inquiries.

The goal is to support LLM-powered systems in resolving partner concerns with compassion, clarity, and accurate policy reference.

---
SECTION 2: CLIENT RELATIONS & SENSITIVITY
---

**1. Addressing Complaints Related to Dignity or Discrimination**
- Always acknowledge and validate client feedback.
- Refer serious complaints (e.g. claims of discriminatory behavior or refusal of service) to Regional Coordinators.
- Ensure clients are aware of alternative food assistance providers (e.g. Manna Food, Hope Center).

_Template:_  
“We’re sorry to hear about this experience. We’ve escalated this to our Regional Team who will follow up. We appreciate your honesty and are here to support you.”

**2. Responding to Disability and Accommodation Concerns**
- Partners are encouraged to provide reasonable accommodations where possible.
- CAFB cannot enforce policy for independent partner operations but can advocate where appropriate.

_Template:_  
“Thank you for sharing your concerns. We’ve referred your case to our Maryland Regional Manager for further review. Our goal is to ensure everyone receives the food assistance they need with dignity.”

---
SECTION 3: PRODUCT ISSUES – REFUNDS & RETURNS
---

**1. Items Infested, Expired, or Incorrectly Labeled**
- Report product issues promptly with photos and quantities.
- Refunds/credits may be issued for purchased goods, pending Operations and Accounting review.
- Donated goods are evaluated case-by-case.

_Template:_  
“We’re sorry to hear about the condition of your product. We’ve alerted our Operations team and will initiate a credit once validated. Please share photos and number of affected cases.”

**2. Unclear Product Descriptions**
- Item listings may lack full clarity (e.g. “winter squash” includes butternut).
- Partners should request clarification or avoid items if unspecific.

_Template:_  
“We understand how important clear descriptions are. We’ve confirmed item 800107 is butternut squash. We’ll continue working with Procurement to improve menu clarity.”

---
SECTION 4: ACCOUNT & ACCESS MANAGEMENT
---

**1. Multiple Site Access Requests**
- Users may request access to multiple agency accounts.
- Each site must have its own login credentials.
- Avoid using the “forgot password” tool when linked to multiple accounts.

_Template:_  
“We’ve updated your access. Please use your credentials for each site separately. Let us know if you have login trouble.”

**2. Updating Public-Facing Contact Info**
- Website and Hunger Heat Map contact details are updated weekly.
- Requests to change internal vs. external listings must be clearly distinguished.

_Template:_  
“We’ve updated your external phone number and retained your personal number for internal use only. The website should reflect this by next week.”

---
SECTION 5: SPECIAL REQUESTS & HOLIDAY-SPECIFIC INQUIRIES
---

**1. Requests for Holiday Boxes or Turkey Distribution**
- CAFB may distribute themed or seasonal boxes (e.g. Thanksgiving).
- These items are often limited and not always published in advance.
- Refer partners to their Regional Coordinator if unavailable online.

_Template:_  
“At this time, we don’t have seasonal boxes listed on the menu. I recommend contacting your Regional Coordinator in case special allocations are being processed.”

---
SECTION 6: VOLUNTEER GUIDELINES & CLIENT ELIGIBILITY
---

**1. Can Volunteers Receive Food Assistance?**
- Yes, but they must qualify the same as clients (e.g. income, zip code).
- Volunteers cannot be required to work in exchange for food.

_Template:_  
“Volunteers may also receive food if they qualify under your site’s eligibility rules. Please create a client profile in Service Insights for tracking.”

---
SECTION 7: CHATBOT RESPONSE EXAMPLES
---

**Partner: “Can we get a refund for spoiled flour?”**  
Chatbot: “So sorry about that! Please send photos and the Sales Order number, and I’ll submit a request for refund review.”

**Partner: “I was insulted by a partner site and denied service.”**  
Chatbot: “I’m so sorry to hear that. I’ve escalated this to our Regional Team who manages site support. Your concern is important to us.”

**Partner: “Why was I charged for delivery as a TEFAP partner?”**  
Chatbot: “If your order included non-TEFAP items, a delivery fee may apply. Let me check your SO and confirm.”

**Partner: “How do I get access to another one of our sites?”**  
Chatbot: “Happy to help! Please provide the agency names and we’ll set up access. Avoid using ‘forgot password’ if you’re linked to multiple accounts.”
