Capital Area Food Bank (CAFB) – Internal LLM Knowledge Base  
Category: Order Modifications – Item Additions

---
SECTION 1: CONTEXTUAL OVERVIEW
---

This Knowledge Base supports CAFB partners seeking to add items to orders after initial submission. This includes adding available inventory before the order locks, responding to site-specific food preferences, navigating produce limits, and understanding system behaviors like cart resets or product shortages.

Partners often request added quantities or new items, especially before major events or holidays. The LLM-backed chatbot should facilitate timely and empathetic assistance, confirm item availability, and escalate when necessary.

---
SECTION 2: COMMON SCENARIOS & RESPONSES
---

**1. Adding Available Items Before Order Lock**
- Partners can request additions up until the order locks (3 business days prior to fulfillment).
- Requests must include Sales Order number and item codes/quantities.

_Template:_  
“Thanks for your request! I’ve added [quantity + item name] to your order [SO#]. Let us know if there’s anything else.”

**2. Item Unavailable or Out of Stock**
- Items may appear available but run out quickly.
- Cart contents do not reserve inventory. Orders are not guaranteed until checkout.

_Template:_  
“Unfortunately, the item you requested is no longer available. Inventory updates rapidly and carts reset nightly. We recommend checking back or exploring alternatives.”

**3. Partner Over Produce Limit**
- Produce is restricted by monthly pound caps.
- Exceptions are rare and must be approved by the Food Resources team.

_Template:_  
“You’ve exceeded your produce limit for the month, so we’re unable to add more produce. You may review your limits or wait until next month.”

**4. Order Locked – Item Cannot Be Added**
- Orders that are locked require manual override or cannot be modified.
- Exceptions may be made for high-need or misbehaving system cases.

_Template:_  
“Your order is currently locked for fulfillment. I’ll check with our Operations team to see if we can make a one-time change.”

**5. Items Dropped from Cart or Order Suddenly**
- This may happen due to expired carts, cart resets, or system limitations.
- IT may investigate persistent issues.

_Template:_  
“Items in carts are not reserved and may disappear if not checked out in time. I understand this is frustrating—let’s see what we can still add to your order.”

SECTION 3: PARTNER BEST PRACTICES
---

✅ DO:
- Include SO numbers and item codes in all requests  
- Confirm item availability in real-time through PartnerLink  
- Submit requests before the order lock window  
- Monitor your produce cap regularly if adding fruits/vegetables  

❌ DON’T:
- Assume saved items will stay in the cart overnight  
- Request last-minute additions without acknowledging potential inventory impact  
- Attempt repeated edits without waiting 30 minutes between changes

SECTION 4: FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
---

**Q: Can I add more items to my order after it’s been submitted?**  
A: Yes, if the order is still editable. If locked, support may try to help based on warehouse status.

**Q: I saw items on the menu, but I couldn’t add them—why?**  
A: Inventory may have changed between viewing and checkout. The system doesn’t hold items in carts.

**Q: Why did my cart reset overnight?**  
A: Carts reset at midnight daily. Items must be checked out to reserve them.

**Q: Can I combine two orders instead of creating a new one?**  
A: It’s not recommended due to produce tracking and routing issues, but support may assist in some cases.

**Q: What if I requested something that’s not available anymore?**  
A: We’ll do our best to find an equivalent. Let us know your priority items.

SECTION 5: CHATBOT RESPONSE EXAMPLES
---

**Partner: “Can I add 5 more boxes of pancake mix?”**  
Chatbot: “Sure! Please share the Sales Order number and item code so I can update your order.”

**Partner: “I couldn’t add chicken to my order, but it was showing as available.”**  
Chatbot: “That can happen when items sell out while you’re checking out. Can you let me know the item number so I can double-check inventory?”

**Partner: “Why does my cart keep clearing out?”**  
Chatbot: “Carts reset every night at midnight. Be sure to finalize your order during the day to secure items.”

**Partner: “I’m over my produce limit. Can I still get apples?”**  
Chatbot: “Thanks for checking. You’re currently over your produce limit, so we can’t add more items right now. You can try again next month.”
