**Capital Area Food Bank (CAFB) - Internal LLM Knowledge Base**  
**Category: Special Requests – Large Event Orders**

---

### SECTION 1: CONTEXTUAL OVERVIEW

This Knowledge Base assists the LLM in addressing partner requests for **large-scale distributions or special events**, such as **holiday pop-ups**, **community giveaways**, and **seasonal outreach initiatives**.

These requests typically involve:
- High-volume food orders (e.g., 500+ boxes)
- Specific food categories like meats, produce, and canned items
- Coordination for events with a defined distribution date
- Requests outside of standard ordering or delivery windows

These events may require support from multiple internal teams (e.g., Programs, Operations, or Food Sourcing).

### SECTION 2: COMMON SCENARIOS & RESOLUTION FLOWS

---

**Scenario 1: Requesting Bulk Food for Holiday or Community Event**
- **Example**: “We want to distribute 500+ boxes on specific dates. Can we get extra food?”
- **Steps**:
  - Ask partner for:
    - Target distribution dates
    - Quantity of households/boxes
    - Preferred product categories (e.g., protein, canned goods)
  - Determine whether the event is a **registered pop-up or outreach event**.
  - Check if the partner is set up to order via PartnerLink.
  - Coordinate internally with **Programs Team** or **Partner Relations** if special allocations are needed.
- **Resolution**:
  - Partner may be granted **temporary access to additional inventory** or a **custom ordering window**.
  - Note: Approval is required for inventory prioritization and coordination with sourcing and delivery schedules.

**Scenario 2: Order Setup for PartnerLink**
- **Example**: “I need to place a bulk order for an event but don’t see the right items in PartnerLink.”
- **Steps**:
  - Confirm if the partner is already registered for PartnerLink.
  - If not:
    - Contact internal support (e.g., Customer Relations or Programs) to create or activate a temporary ordering profile.
    - Set up a special ordering window and guide them through the ordering process.
- **Resolution**:
  - Partner successfully places a bulk order in PartnerLink tied to the event date.
  - Communicate next steps (pickup, delivery scheduling, item availability).

**Scenario 3: Short-Notice or Unscheduled Special Requests**
- **Example**: “We’re hosting an event next weekend — can we get extra items?”
- **Steps**:
  - Inform the partner that **CAFB needs adequate lead time** for special order fulfillment.
  - Encourage submitting large-event requests **at least 2 weeks in advance**.
- **Resolution**:
  - If possible, process a manual allocation or connect with the Programs Team for support.
  - Otherwise, offer next-available standard menu options.
