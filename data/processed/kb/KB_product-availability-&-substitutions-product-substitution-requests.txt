SECTION 1: CONTEXTUAL OVERVIEW
---

This knowledge base provides LLM guidance for assisting CAFB partners requesting substitutions or asking about unavailable or ready-to-eat products, such as milk, juice boxes, applesauce cups, cereals, etc. These inquiries are often driven by the needs of guests who may be unhoused and require convenient, no-prep meals.

Substitution requests commonly relate to:
- Ready-to-eat (RTE) items
- Storage and distribution volume constraints
- Custom food mixes tailored for homeless or high-need populations
- Questions about PartnerLink product availability
