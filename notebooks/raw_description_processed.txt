The deadline on our grant (FY24 MD Region MOCO 1-H) for $3,097.61 is May 27, 2024. When we tried to enter an order to use up that grant there were no delivery times available before May 27, because of the holiday weekend. We spoke with Charity in Partner Support and she told us to submit our order with a May 28 delivery day and then email you to get the deadline extended by a day. In addition to extending the deadline, please have your finance department deduct the order from the above mentioned grant. The computer automatically deducted it from our next MOCO grant which expires in June. I apologize for causing you extra work. Thank you for your assistance. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions. Terry C: 240-793-5108

Our delivery equipment cannot navigate through snow or ice safely, and we prioritize the safety of both our drivers and your staff. We appreciate your cooperation and understanding as we work together to ensure everyone's safety during this weather event.

We are reaching out to address the challenges posed by the inclement weather we have experienced over the past couple of days. Unfortunately, this has left us two days behind in our pulling schedule, which has led us to make the difficult decision to cancel the orders originally scheduled for Wednesday, January 8th. We sincerely regret any inconvenience this may cause to your distribution plans. We understand how vital these deliveries are to your operations. *We encourage you to respond to this email and let us know whether you would like to finalize the cancellation of your order or reschedule it.* Please note that we will need a response from your agency by the end of the business day ( *5 pm*) on *January 7th*, or the order will be canceled on our end. Please note that we are rescheduling orders, with the earliest openings being mid-week next week. This is due to our delivery and pickup schedules being full before the snow we experienced this week. Please reach out to us to coordinate further! We are fully aware of the impact that inclement weather can have on our collective efforts, and we remain committed to ensuring the safety of our staff and yours during this time. Thank you for your understanding and support as we navigate this situation together. We are working quickly to get back on schedule. Warm regards, Customer Relations

Dear Partner Support Team, I hope this email finds you well. My name is Taylor Allgood, and I am with The Market at American University which recently placed an order through the Capital Area Food Bank. We recently learned that oatmeal is now available for free on your website, and we would greatly appreciate including some in our current order for *Monday, January 6*, if it is still possible to make modifications. We understand that the 24-hour window to modify or cancel the order has passed as of 1/1/25. However, since it has only been one day beyond this period, I wanted to kindly ask if you might be able to add a few boxes of oatmeal to our order. We completely understand if the timing makes this addition difficult, but we wanted to reach out in case it is feasible. In any case, we truly thank you for all your support. Best regards, Taylor Allgood Student Support Coordinator The Market, American University tallgood@american.edu

Could you please let us know what the process would be for rescheduling or managing the delivery if the university is closed? We want to ensure weâ€™re prepared and can coordinate appropriately. Thank you for your guidance and support. Best regards,

Hi,_x000D_ _x000D_ I picked up an order for Annandale UMC this morning in Lorton and discovered upon unloading that I was given the wrong item. I had ordered six cases of canned black beans and instead received six cases of canned pinto beans. I realize it is partially my fault for not checking before loading the vehicle and I probably would have noticed had I been asked to sign for receipt, but I wasnâ€™t._x000D_ _x000D_ Ideally, Iâ€™d like to exchange the beans the next time I pick up an order.

Hello, Of late, I am not getting a phone call letting me know that the driver is on their way to our Pantry. I enter a note for each of our orders asking that a driver call as they are leaving the warehouse so that our volunteers have enough time to get to our location when the truck arrives. We are a small organization - and our Pantry is just that - a large closet that stores a tremendous amount of food. We deliver our food to the clients so there is no 'office' available for volunteers to wait. When I scheduled today's delivery, a morning slot was not available. I had written asking if there would be any way to move our delivery up since we are normally an early delivery partner. I was told that the delivery schedule was full for the morning so that I had to keep my noon - 2 pm slot. I happened to be at the Pantry to do some stocking and the truck arrived at 10 AM! Luckily we were able to meet the driver with no delay to his schedule. I would appreciate it if drivers could please view the special notes/instructions for each delivery. I have been told by a few drivers that they do not see the special notes on their delivery receipt. Thank you for your help - Angela Harvey Pantry Manager, Bethesda Help

Hello - Our order (SO187548) arrived on Wednesday at 10:30 am. The order was scheduled to arrive between 12 - 2 pm. I did not receive a call. Of late, I have not been receiving calls from the driver letting me know that they have left the warehouse. Our Pantry is VERY small (but mighty). My volunteers that help unload the pallets do not arrive until I let them know the truck's ETA. So if a driver doesn't call, I may not be at the Pantry to receive it. Will is a great driver - so I did not say anything about not giving me a call on Wednesday - I happen to be at the Pantry so he was able to drop off my 2 pallets earlier than scheduled. My next order (1/8/2025) is again scheduled for a 12 - 2 pm delivery... though I would rather have a morning delivery appointment. Can my order please be moved?

I am writing this to let you know about an issue with our food delivery this morning 11/15. We ordered a total of 8 or 9 pallets of vegetables this morning. However, those pallets were stacked on top of each other as a pair when they were delivered. We asked the driver if he could bring the pallets down since they are very heavy (about 800 lbs each) and our office did not have any equipment to handle that. He said that there was nothing he could do because they were loaded into the truck like that. We did have this issue in the past and it took our staff (which comprised of many seniors) a tremendous amount of effort to handle it. We always appreciate CAFB for providing the food for free, but in the future, it would be great if you do not stack pallets on top of each other. If you have no choice but to do so, please let us know in advance.

I am writing this because we encountered a technical issue on the website. Last Friday 11/22, we tried to add a few items, namely 2 of the *800908 Cabbage, Green Local 675# BIN 1/675 lbs Bin* into our cart, to be delivered this Wednesday 11/27. However, it said that those items were not available on that selected date, but in the item description, it said that it will still be available until 12/10. As a result, we could not select those items back then. It was pretty late then, so I was not able to email you until today. I know that we may past the deadline for edit order; however, is it possible for you to remove all of the "300597 Turkey Breast, 6-9# Basted w/ Gravy Packet 1/30.42486 lbs Case" from our cart, and replace them with 2 of the "800908 Cabbage, Green Local 675# BIN 1/675 lbs Bin?" Additionally, do we still need to order more than 1000 lbs to be eligible for delivery? I know that we are asking a lot Alanna, but we want to make sure that our vulnerable and underserved population can enjoy a good Thanksgiving this week. We would appreciate a lot if you can help us.

Good afternoon, I wanted to follow up with you all regarding the issue with Capital Christian Fellowship's produce hub earlier this week. CCF adds food and edits the SO I make for their produce hubs. In the past few months, they have added thousands of pounds of food to these orders, making them close to 40k pounds sometimes. For the most recent hub order, someone at CCF accidentally removed 3k pounds of produce meant for the produce hub. Christ let me know that this can happen since the produce is marked as available for agencies and CAFB staff. We are having a meeting tomorrow with CCF to discuss the produce hub orders. I wanted to reach out to you all to get your insight on whether it would be beneficial for Transportation/Ops if I told CCF that *they cannot add/modify* produce hub SOs anymore. However, I wouldn't want CCF to create additional orders during the same time and further strain the capacity of Transportation/Ops. If there is a specific pound limit that I should tell them not to exceed when adding food to the produce hub SOs, I can do that as well. I know that the produce limitations will impact their ordering, so their order sizes will probably decrease in the next few months. Please let me know if there is anything you would like me to mention during the meeting tomorrow. Thank you again for all your help! Best, Grace Ferrara !image.png|thumbnail!

Good afternoon CAFB, I hope your day has started well! We have a delivery this morning (SO177245) but I think the driver made a mistake: we received 4 BINs of sweet potatoes instead of 2 BINs of sweet potatoes and 2 BINs of apples. Is it possible to have apples today? Be blessed!--

Good morning CAFB, Yesterday I emailed you that we had not received the corn. Just to let you know that we saw the boxes of corn. In fact, the boxes were under several boxes of beans and this did not allow us to easily locate them. I would also like to inform you that among the beans, we found a large number of severely dented canned beans that we had to throw away since we cannot offer them to our guests. Have a blessed day. --

Good morning CAFB, I hope your day is going wonderfully! So far, I have not yet seen the truck for the Delivery Hub. He was supposed to be here since 8 a.m. and now it's 10 a.m. Will the truck come?

Hi CAFB team, I hope my email finds you well. It is Capital Christian Fellowship. We received part of our order early this afternoon and the driver said there is another truck coming.

Good morning, Do you think the request not to stack could be adhered to? If so, I will put a note on their future produce hub orders. I am not sure who to loop in from ops, so please feel free to loop them in as needed. Thank you, Augusta *From:* Marie Odah *Sent:* Thursday, August 15, 2024 4:23 PM *To:* Augusta Fricke *Subject:* Produce Hub Request Hi Augusta, I hope my email finds you well. I have a request about the Produce Hub: is it possible that the pallets of produce are not stacked on top of each other? SEED comes with a truck like the one from CAFB so it uses the pallet jack to pick up their produce but when the pallets are stacked on top of each other, we have no way to lower the pallet of produce which is on top which we forced to cut the cardboard, to extract the product into a bin so that another partner can have its product. If the pallets come individually, each organization has the possibility of collecting its pallet of produce to its truck. Also I looked at the order for the Hub but I only saw 50 squash boxes instead of 176 (the 58 boxes are the ones I ordered for my distribution). Will the rest be added later? Thank you Augusta * *Marie ODAH* * * *Administrative Assistant* * * *Coordinator of Food Pantry & Immigrant Resourcing* * * *Capital Christian Fellowship* * " *_ *_For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on him should not perish, but have eternal life_* _* ." !~WRD0001.jpg|thumbnail!

Good morning CAFB team, I hope my email finds you well. The form to make the request is no longer available which is why I am sending you this email. CAFB has given our Food pantry a limit of 16,250 pounds per month but we would be grateful if we could have a very higher produce allocation otherwise our distribution will be in trouble. The first reason is that each week we have over 500 guests at our Food distribution (several times we have already exceeded 600 guests!) and the number is only increasing. We have 4 distributions in a month. 16,250 pounds per month is 8 pallets per month. We cannot feed more than 500 people per week with only 8 pallets per month so we will be forced to reduce our distribution to 1 day per month instead of 4 per month. 8 pallets is the minimum number of pallets of food we use for a single distribution in the month. If you look at our order history, for the past several months we have been doing 2 orders per week, one on Tuesday and one on Wednesday in order to have enough produce for all the families that come. The second reason is that CAFB is our only food supplier. If you maintain the limit of 16,250 pounds per month, the question for us will be: how are we going to get the difference in food that we will no longer have? Having no other suppliers, the only solution will still be to reduce the distribution days. The third reason is that we do not make our choices based on the pound because we have the space in our Gym to store at least 40 pallets against the wall, if they are pallets stored one on top of the other, that makes us more than 80 and we can also store 12 pallets in our Food pantry room so we have plenty of space to store the food. We make our choices taking into account the diversity of food because of the diversity of cultures who come to take the food. I hope that all these explanations will make us find favor in your eyes so that you increase our pound limit. Thank you in advance. Be blessed! --

Good morning CAFB, I hope my email finds you well! I sent you yesterday an email about a message that appears on your site while placing orders but I did not receive an answer yet. The message says â€œYou are required to verify all your hours of operation records before 10/1/2024 or your account will be locked.â€ What hours of operation must be recorded? I don't really understand this message. Thank you in advance for the explanation. Also in our October 1st order (SO176185), there is item 100773 Good Culture Probiotic Whole Milk which needs to be refrigerated. Is it possible for it to be delivered with our other orders on Wednesday, which is our distribution day? This will save us the storage problem. Thank you in advance. Be blessed! --

Good afternoon Team CAFB, Hope you had a great Thanksgiving! We have a concern about the milk that will be delivered to us on Wednesday, December 4 (SO184675). Is it possible that for this time, the amount will be reduced to *80 cases* instead of 108. The reason is that at our last milk distribution, we noticed that our guests were very careful about the best by/expiration date and we had milk that was left over. This was not a problem at that time because we were able to keep them in the refrigerator until the following food distribution. But, we have the same leftover milk, we do not have enough space in the refrigerator at the moment to keep them and we do not want to waste food. This is why we want to be careful. Thank you in advance for your understanding. Have a blessed day! --

Hello, I just spoke with Ms. Burks about the $75 delivery charge on invoice 171178. Her entire order consisted of free produce. Although a grant wasn't used, all items, except the cantaloupe, were categorized as MD TEFAP. Could you please review and confirm whether the cantaloupe was placed in the correct category and if the delivery fee is accurate? If the charge is valid, would it be possible to reach out to Austin to inquire about waiving the fee? Following that, could we update Ms. Burks on the outcome? Unfortunately, Friday is my last day before maternity leave, so I won't be able to handle the follow-up myself. Thank you for your assistance.

The Parter Support team members are wizards and can fix almost anything related to PartnerLink or deliveries! I am CCing them on this email to start a help ticket for . As I understand it, you have been overcharged for several items because you didnâ€™t actually receive the number of cases reflected on the Sales Order (Spaghetti, black beans, milk). could you all please process a refund for these items? Regarding the +extra+ cases delivered, I am not an expert on what to do, so Iâ€™ll let Partner Support weigh in. Thank you!

Hi Maria, Thank you for reaching out about these issues with your order. Iâ€™m adding on this email so that they can decide how best to proceed. Donâ€™t ever hesitate to reach out about incorrect orders, even if itâ€™s just a minor mistake. We want to be sure our inventory is always correct, so it helps to have partners let us know when weâ€™ve made a mistake.

Rodriguez *Sent:* Wednesday, November 13, 2024 2:33 PM *To:* Joanna Miller *Subject:* Order #SO182764 Hello Joanna, I just came back from vacation yesterday and was looking over our inventory to compose our guidelines for this week and noticed that the chicken that we received on Friday was not the TEFAP chicken that we had ordered for pick up on 11/08. It's on our team for not checking properly the case size and weight but the chicken which we received was the following: 300595 Chicken Leg Quarters, Halal 5# Chicken Leg Quarters, Halal 5# 6/5 lbs Bag We received 9 cases of the above chicken. I knew it wasn't correct based on the count and the fact that it was halal. I believe this is a purchase item through the CAFB website and wanted to check with you and the team to see how you would like to proceed. As a side note, on a past order we received 6 cases of TEFAP red kidney beans instead we had ordered 6 cases of TEFAP pears which was a minor problem and explained the importance of checking the order with our team prior to accepting.

Hi "D", Passing this along directly to you as we have received quite a few complaints about the canned peaches. Did you ever hear back from the Warehouse about if they have been able to check the rest of the boxes? Also are you all able to connect with Emily directly about her refund request? Thank you, Alanna ---- *From:* Emily Ewing *Sent:* Sunday, February 23, 2025 8:41 AM *To:* Alanna King *Subject:* Damaged food Alanna We received a delivery of food on Tuesday, February 18. Everything was fine except for one case of peaches. 17 cans out of 24 in the case were damaged. I have pictures below. The cans with the black spots are holes where the juice leaked out. The two cans on paper had leaked and were stuck to the paper. You can see all the cans that were wet. We cannot give out food that is stained like this; plus, we have no way of knowing if the contents are bad. We could use only 7 cans from this box. Since prices are so much higher now and our money is tighter, we would like a refund. I have not heard anything about the cans of pears that were damaged a few weeks ago. Have a good week.

To whom it may concern, I called partner support to have item # 100794 frozen assorted meals full pallet 1,500 Moved from delivery day 11/27/24 to 11/26/24. It was added to invoice #184911 and delivered on 11/26/24. But on 11/27/24 the driver called me to say he was about to delivery the assorted meals. I explained the situation and he said he would call the office and return The meals. When I went to pay my invoices on 12/15/24, the invoice for the 11/27/24 for $75.00 for the frozen meals were still in the system when it should have been deleted. Please help me resolve this issue problem. Phone # 240-398-1681 Thank You, Mary Collins

Hello, this inquiry relates to maintaining inventory reports for food delivery and distribution at the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Woodbridge, Virginia. After reviewing the records, we received an order on September 27, 2024, and only received a copy of the delivery sheet page one. However, on the page it is note as page one of two. We did not observe a page two. We would like a copy of page two for our inventory records. IF it is possible an emailed copy would be helpful. Also, the delivery reports for September 27, 2024, and October 25, 2024, document the delivery of item 540184 (VA-TEFAP Canned, Beef Stew 24oz 24.24oz Case. Both deliveries were not cans of beef stew but beef stew pouches (item 540073). Our inquiry is for having the correct item numbers and product listed on our inventory reports. If you can respond to this email message with a copy of the page two delivery document for the delivery September 27, 224 and share instructions for coding the inventory reports regarding the Beef stew (cans versus pouches) for the months of September and October, it would be appreciated.

Good morning. FISH of Laurel is so very happy to receive this $6006.85 grant as it has been many years since we have received a grant from CAFB! I have a question about invoice #194073 (this orderÂ #SO192982 was received on 2/13; it was originally scheduled for delivery on 2/10, but there was a problem that day and the driver failed to arrive during the 8:00-10:00 AM delivery window). On 2/14, we received the following email: Dear FISH of Laurel, Inc., We are delighted to inform you that your organization has been awardedÂ grantÂ funding to support your efforts in addressing food security in our community.Â *$6,006.85* Â has been awarded to your organization under the new food creditÂ grantÂ â€“Â FY25 Maryland DHSÂ and the funds were made available in your account onÂ Monday,Â February 10th, 2025. Partner food credits can be used by your organization toÂ purchaseÂ grantÂ eligible items using CAFBâ€™s Partner Link Menu.Â Â Your partner food creditÂ grantÂ deadline is May 15th, 2025. Please remember that the food creditÂ grantÂ deadline is applied to the delivery or pick up scheduled date, not the date you placed the order. CAFB reserves the right to change deadlines and to reallocate and/or extendÂ grantÂ deadlines based on partner usage to ensure contract requirements are being met. If your organization cannot use the fullÂ grantÂ amount before the deadline, please tell us as soon as possible.Â Â Â Â Â Â Are you able to apply the grant to this order? I believe that a number of items on this order are grant designated. Thanks. Linda

Please see the photo I uploaded. When we received this masa harina, there was clearly a rodent bite taken out of one of the 10 bags in that package. I would like a partial refund for the damaged bag. Also, a mouse was under the palette that the driver dropped off! I guess he was busy snacking during the ride to our location. Thanks.

As Donna mentioned, our agency contact info is changing. Donna and I will continue to be the day-to-day contacts and need to receive copies of any and all communications from CAFB to ensure you get any necessary response from Floris. Shell Lewis, the Director of Serve Ministries, will vacate her role next week. The position had not yet been filled. Allan Ballenger has retired as the Executive Director. As of yesterday, Barbara Miner (bminer@florisumc.org) is now our Executive Pastor. Though she will probably be the one who signs the partner agreement, she has no involvement in the day to day operation of our food distribution program and would prefer not to receive routine emails from CAFB. If you need us to complete a form, please let me know. Thanks! Katie Rakestraw Floris UMC 703-798-5826

Good morning. I notice that the June early closure and blackout dates are published on Partnerlink - thank you! July 4 falls on Thursday this year. Will the food bank be closed just on July 4, or will there also be service interruptions on the 5th? There've also been some summer shut-downs for staff activities in the past; are any of those on the horizon? It's really helpful to know those dates as far in advance as practical. Thank you!

Hello, Thank you for reaching out. If the order could be rescheduled to a time later this week that would be great.

We would like to add additional grapes to our order if they are available. It was difficult to determine how many actual bags of grapes would be delivered. The description is not very clear. If possible weâ€™d like to add an additional 20 cases (8 bags per case) to this order. Also, if there will be other produce added weâ€™d like to have that added such as potatoes regular or sweet and any other items available. We serve 375 families and weâ€™d like to provide adequate produce for them. The distribution is this coming Saturday, Oct 26th. Thank you in advance for any assistance you can provide.
END OF TICKET
The items being requested appear on the shopping list but, not available for our delivery date. Weâ€™d really like to have these produce items. Please let me know if these items will be added to our order or if other produce may be available to add.

Please reach out to us to coordinate further! We are fully aware of the impact that inclement weather can have on our collective efforts, and we remain committed to ensuring the safety of our staff and yours during this time.

In fact, last month HELP served 500 families at our pantry in the Festival Shopping Center. We have only a couple of volunteer drivers who can deliver food, and we must reserve that service for those individuals who live alone or have a partner who also can't drive to the pantry. You had asked for us to deliver food to a family of 9 people. As you must know from your previous food pickups, which total 30 since 2018, we pack according to family size; so a family of 9 would receive at least 8 heavy bags of groceries. We simply can't ask a volunteer, all of whom tend to be over 60 years of age, to pick up and deliver many bags of groceries; and that would not be appropriate when there are able-bodied family members in residence. As an all-volunteer organization, we strive to serve as many families as possible; but we can sustain our operation only if almost all of our families pick up at the pantry. If a client needs to come to the pantry via bus, we offer bus tokens so that transportation to and from the pantry is free. It is not an insult to let someone know that we have limited capabilities for food delivery. It's just a fact. And we would not ask to see proof of disability. We explain our limited delivery ability to any client who asks about delivery. Also, our coordinators always provide information about how to get food from Manna and/or the Gaithersburg Hope Center. Clients can get food from us while also getting food from those other organizations. In that way, we hope clients find they have more money to apply toward rent or utility bills. Our yearly client survey results validate that outcome and that our volunteers treat clients with dignity and promptness. We could serve your family very quickly with food if someone could drive to the pantry or come via bus. Margo On Thu, Nov 14, 2024 at 2:11â€¯PM 'Yvette Jackson' via Info wrote: Dear Capital Area Food Bank Support Team, My name is Yvette Jackson, and I am writing to report an issue I experienced with food assistance delivery from Gaithersburg HELP. On Monday at 9:36 a.m., I called to apply for food assistance delivery, but my request was refused based on the number of people in my household and our ages. Specifically, this refusal has caused significant inconveniences and insult to my family and me, as we urgently need food assistance. Insulting my family by indicating "With such a large family someone should be able to take the bus here for pick up!" shows a lack of empathy and compassion. After making a complaint, I received a response at 12:54 p.m. today, indicating that the refusal and statement were correct due to the volunteer nature of the service and their inability to deliver help to a large household. I was directed to seek assistance from other sources such as Manna Food. I believe there might be a misunderstanding or miscommunication regarding our eligibility for this service. Attached to this email, you will find documentation of my disability for your review. Please note the MetroAccess document on line 16, which indicates that my disability prevents me from independently using the accessible Metrobus and Metrorail system for all trips. I am unable to walk due to L spine disease with a risk of falls, panic attacks, anxiety, and non-tolerance to crowds. At this point, I feel my disability, age, and household circumstances are severely limiting my access to essential help. I would appreciate your assistance in reviewing this matter and providing any necessary support to ensure that my household can receive the food assistance we need as it appears Gaithersburg Help is not completely meeting the needs of the community. I value your prompt attention to this issue and look forward to your response.

Hi, A partner reached out re: SO187723 they ordered item 520088, which is listed as "MD TEFAP Plums Pitted + Dried," but received bags labeled "prunes."

Good morning, I have a question on items from two previous orders From SO161546 (6/7/24): We ordered salad dressing 111043. The items had assorted dates that had best by dates past 6 months or more. Are they OK since the majority of them are cream based? !IMG_20240617_083143.jpg|thumbnail! From SO163161 (6/14/24): I had asked for best by dates for items but the dates on the reply email did not match the items we received except for 1. Are the dates sent on the email the best until dates: 100856 - Hot fries, 100854 - Glutino bars, 100858 - Caramel Popcorn? The best by dates are important to us because it tells us how much to order if we want to keep items for future distributions.

Good morning, This past Friday, we received 3 produce items that should not have been delivered especially the mustard greens. This is from SO180219. The the mustard greens was already breaking down and gave off a terrible smell. Both the yellow summer squash and strawberry only 50% usable. The yellow squash looked like it was frozen and then defrosted with some molds. The strawberries were moldy. Both items did not look like they had significant issues from initial inspection. It is only when you start taking them out really looking carefully that you would notice the quality issues. I do not have pictures of the strawberries but I do have pictures of the mustard greens and the yellow summer squash.

----- Forwarded Message ----- *From:* "Dreydrey Pig" *To:* "partnersupport@capitalareafoodbank.com" *Cc:* "Augusta Fricke" *Sent:* Thu, Aug 15, 2024 at 4:51 PM *Subject:* Item removed from order Hello, i just saw that item 100757 was removed from our delivery tomorrow. It is a pallet of meals to go that we were going to offer our clients as back to school choice. We were planning giving at least 2-3 per family. Right now we are going to end up giving 1 per family. It is disappointing. I dropped the other individual cases and decided on a pallet thinking that surely CAFB knows how many full pallets they have of an item since it is large and there are only 15 posted (at least when I initially saw it). It is even more disappointing because every week it seems as though an item is being removed from our order. This week it is a full pallet of meals to go. Last week it was 6 cases of eggs, and 3 weeks ago a bin or corn. I thought that when the number of items get posted to Partner Link, these are the number of items available to order. I am trying to understand why the items are missing by the time items get pulled. And it should not be happening almost every week. I have the same pallet ordered for delivery date 8/23. Am I going to assume that item is also gone since the same item is now not available or missing? We appreciate what you all do but there is always room for improvement. Thank you for your time and help. Sincerely, Andrea

However, when I go to edit a pending order, the EDIT button is greyed out with a notation about editing not possible with credit card orders. The order information shows it was placed via INVOICE. I donâ€™t know if this is an issue only for our organization. Alanna had offered that perhaps the problem is caused by the credit card listed in the database for us (although not used for the order). It is very helpful to review the menu while an order is pending to be able to add any needed items that were not on the menu at the time of placing the order. I request attention to this problem so that we may again have the ability to edit our pending orders as needed. Your assistance on this matter is greatly appreciated! Thank you Nancye Campbell Coordinator, Groveton Baptist Church

Hello, I attended this training on the August 6th Zoom. Thank you, Samantha Stevens On Fri, Sep 13, 2024 at 2:37â€¯PM Customer Support ( ) wrote: Good afternoon Partners, If you are receiving this email, it means you have not yet attended one of our mandatory Hours of Operations Trainings. There is a new feature available on PartnerLink that allows partners to update their hours of operations for their distributions. This feature will enable you to keep your records up to date as required, which is important for ensuring that we have the most current information in our internal systems for our clients to use. Once approved, the information collected from your updates will be linked to our online tool that clients can use to find food assistance: . To ensure that all partners understand how to use this function, we have hosted three trainings, and there is one session remaining on *September 19th from 9 am to 10 am* . These sessions have been designed to demonstrate how to use this feature and provide an opportunity to speak to our team about PartnerLink and offer feedback. Please note that this training is mandatory. You can use this link to your agency. Once you fill out the form entirely, a Zoom link with a calendar invite will be sent to your email. We only require one representative per agency to attend, but we encourage all shoppers who have access to PartnerLink to join. We suggest that this person work closely with the food program and have a deep understanding of operations. While the training will be recorded and slides will be shared, all partners are expected to attend the live (online) training to meet the requirement. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact Customer Relations. Thank you, The Customer Relations Team

Please proceed with caution if asked to click links or open attachments.** * Hi Kate, Thank you for reaching out about this! While the Good Samaritan Law does protect food pantries and food banks from civil liability, we do still monitor the FDA recall announcements to ensure the safety of our clients. Please see CAFB's recall policy below. In addition to this, I am not sure of other healthcare providers who may have a policy in place for this. Gillian may be able to provide support there! Let me know if I can help with anything else! Alanna Food Recall Policy: A food recall, as defined by the FDA, involves removing foods from the market that violate the regulations set by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Foods are recalled for various reasons, primarily due to contamination or failure to disclose essential allergens on the product label. It's important for food suppliers and distributors to stay informed about recalls, as consuming recalled foods may lead to illness or injury. If a product is recalled, the details will be specific to the item reflecting the brand, product name, freeze-by date, and other relevant information pertaining to that specific product. Items that do not match the description provided in the recall notice are not affected and can be safely consumed. In the event of a recall, it is recommended to return the product to the place of purchase or dispose of it to prevent consumption. The Capital Area Food Bank constantly monitors FDA food recall notifications and maintains regular contact with vendors and suppliers. In the event that we are made aware of a recalled inventory item, we will take immediate steps to remove it from all upcoming orders and notify our partners who may have received the item since it was added to our menu. Our Customer Service Team will use various communication channels to promptly inform all partners about the recall and the necessary steps to take with the product. If you have received an item from Capital Area Food Bank that you suspect has caused illness, please contact Customer Relations immediately. Provide your contact information, the date and time of the distribution where the food was distributed to clients, a description of the issue with the product, the item number/name, the date you received the product from our warehouse, and any illness or injury resulting from consuming the item. The Customer Relations Team will handle your complaint seriously and alert the relevant teams at Capital Area Food Bank to address the issue promptly. If you have any questions about this process, please contact or 202-644-9845. !image003.png|thumbnail! * *Alanna King* * (she/her) Partnership Specialist, VA Region Capital Area Food Bank * *P.* * 571.482.4773 | + + 6833 Hill Park Dr, Lorton, VA 22079 + + !image004.png|thumbnail! !image005.png|thumbnail! !image006.png|thumbnail! !image007.png|thumbnail! | !image008.png|thumbnail! | | | | ---- * *From:* * Garsson, Kate *Sent:* Wednesday, December 11, 2024 2:00 PM *To:* Alanna King ; Gillian Kimura *Subject:* Quick Question Good afternoon! We are creating an internal process for handling food recalls for our food programs. To inform this process, Iâ€™m hoping to learn from others doing this work. Do you know any healthcare systems/providers that have on-site pantries, and if so, can you connect me? Also, from what I understand food banks/pantries donâ€™t do any notifications for recalls due to the Good Samaritan law. However, I want to make sure Iâ€™m correct â€“ does CAFB do anything for recalls, i.e. notifying pantries who received affected food?

Good afternoon, I just wanted to gain some clarification on the attached invoices starting with #157394. I purchased all grant eligible items but we somehow still have a $196.08 balance. Could someone explain this considering we still have grant funds left? The other invoice shows a balance of .46 cents. I wanted to bring this to the attention of our finance team so we could best address this. I would assume we are not going to cut a check for .46 cents but either way I wanted to alert our finance team. Please advise on how to proceed with this invoice. Thanks!

Dear Partner Support, Last Friday, 2/14/25, sale order SO194429 was delivered to our location. It included 3 bins of cereal, item 100862. At first sight, we noticed rodent droppings on top of cereal boxes in one of those bins. That bin was not accepted and the delivery driver loaded it back up inside his truck. The other two bins were b *r* ought upstairs to our storage room. To our surprise, a few minutes later, we saw a mouse coming out of one bin and returning inside that bin. We had to act quickly since other food items were stored inside this room. We immediately wrapped both bins, loaded them inside our vehicle and drove to two landfill sites to dispatch the two open bins with donated assorted cereal. Upon dispatching them, our staff saw two mice. This confirmed our fear that more than one mouse had entered inside our building and our storage room through the open bin cereals that we ordered. Of course, the issue was not over and the following Monday, 2/17/25, we caught another mouse. We will continue to closely monitor our storage room and other areas to be certain that the problem has been eradicated. Attached are pictures of what was left behind after we removed the two bins out of the storage room. This experience was very disturbing, and a solution needs to be implemented quickly. This put us behind schedule by four days due to the intervention that we put in place. We also had to throw away our products that the mice had contaminated. CAFB has been such a great partner to us and we are forever grateful for the 'all in' support that you have been providing us to allow us to help our underserved communities. That is why we are sharing this information and our experience to you so this can be further looked at and hopefully avoided. We are in this together to strengthen food security, so we know this kind of issue will be attended to and taken seriously by both parties. We look forward to your feedback or resolution around this matter. Thank you and Best regards, Anna Beavan and Jeannette Mendy Jeannette Mendy

Lucy, First, let me thank you and the TEFAP program for allowing us to serve. We have been a part of the Capital Area Food Bank since 2009, that's 15 years of service. The volunteers that come to work with us do so at the kindness of their heart. Our Community is mult-cultural. People who are afraid of the impact of completing the form. At the Civil Rights meeting, I asked the question of how we can educate the community to help them understand that they wouldn't lose their benefits by completing the form. By saying, you can't have food unless you fill out the form is heartbreaking. We are doing what we can, and to constantly be threatened of suspension is not a good feeling. I can't imagine any agency taking such steps over FOOD. These volunteers have worked tirelessly. If you need to come and get the foods we have, please feel free to do so. Let us know the date and time so that someone will be available. I spoke to Cynthia, and she informed me that *NO TEFAP Food* was distributed in August. I will do the inventory, send you the forms we collected and that is all we can do. Best Dr. Claudine Head On Thu, Oct 24, 2024 at 9:34â€¯AM Lucy Paredes wrote: Good Morning Dr. Head, I thought it would be best to answer on this email thread as you can more easily refer back to the Corrective Action Plan attached to the first email. I appreciate you sending along the pictures of the temperature logs and the civil rights training certificate. The Corrective Action Plan outlines 2 issues, the missing SDI forms and missing inventory reports. The due date of 10/23/2024 was for the signed Corrective Action Plan to be emailed back to me along with a plan to prevent this issue from happening again in the future, please see the last bullet point below each issue, and lastly the missing inventory reports to be submitted. In your case, that is May and August of 2024. Like said in one of the emails below, if you submitted the missing months, you should have received an email with a PDF copy via email. If you could send me that, then it would clear up the missing inventory reports. Since I will be out of town tomorrow, Friday 10/25 and Monday 10/28, I will allow for one additional extension. The new date is Wednesday, October 30th, 2024. Please know that if these items are not submitted by end of day on October 30th, there will be a suspension placed on your TEFAP account. Any suspension that I do does not impact your ability to order regular CAFB food.

Good Morning, A few months ago, we were contacted about switching our distribution day from Tuesday to a later day in the week, and we agreed to move it to Wednesday. However, weâ€™ve found that having only one day between our distribution dates has been challenging for our volunteers and has created scheduling conflicts with some of our other pickups. Now that the holidays are over, weâ€™d like to request switching back to our original Tuesday distribution. This change would allow us to serve the community more effectively and provide our volunteers with adequate time to recover between distributions. We understand the importance of aligning with your delivery schedule and want to remain considerate of your operations. However, we would greatly appreciate it if this adjustment could be made. Please let us know if this is possible. Looking forward to hearing from you. Best regards, Oliver

Hi - We received 1 - 825068 Cantaloupe FULL PALLET 72cs today. Sadly, we have gone through 40+ of the 72 cases (and going through more) and the cantaloupe is moldy, and spoiled. We are disappointed that we are not able to give to our clients and this was a very bountiful item. Attached are some images showing the issue. As we know we are not able to give out, we are asking and seeing if a truck can come to pick up to dispose. Having nearly 2600 pounds of spoiled food will dramatically take out our resources for disposing. Thank you in advance for your quick response to this matter. - Chris --

The volunteers had to clean off all the other bags and had to throw away 20 bags in the fight with the insects that were alive and fighting back. Is there a way for us to get a refund for the bags that we had to throw away? Of course we would prefer not to have cooties in our corn flour order so please keep those to the manufacturer to discard before sending (ha, ha ha).

Thank you in advance. ---- *From:* Customer Support (partnersupport@capitalareafoodbank.org) *Sent:* Wednesday, August 28, 2024 12:05 PM *To:* omolayo50@msn.com *Subject:* New PartnerLink Feature- only 2 more training sessions left! Good morning, partners, We are excited to announce that the new PartnerLink feature is now live! This feature will allow partners to update their hours of operations for their distributions. This new feature is very exciting because it means that you will be able to update your records whenever necessary. This ensures that we have the most up-to-date information in our internal systems and for clients to utilize. As a reminder, once approved, the information we gather from your updates will be linked to the information provided in our online tool that clients can use to locate food assistance: . To ensure that all partners understand how to utilize this function, we planned to host two trainings, two of which have already occurred and *+two+* more in the month of September. These sessions are designed to demonstrate how to use this feature and also provide an opportunity to talk to our team about PartnerLink and provide feedback. Please note that this training is *+mandatory+*. You can use the links below to register your agency. We only require one representative per agency to attend, but we welcome and encourage all shoppers who have access to PartnerLink to join. We recommend that this person work closely with the food program and has a deep understanding of operations. While the training will be recorded and slides will be shared, *all partners are expected to attend the live training to fulfill the requirement*. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact Customer Relations. Please to register. Upon selecting a training date and completing the form, you will receive the corresponding Zoom link via email. We are also excited to announce that the Customer Relations team will be hosting office hours every Wednesday in August & September from 10 am to 11 am starting August 14th. If you have any questions or support needs related to the new PartnerLink feature, this time is available to you. Additionally, this opportunity will allow partners to interact with the Customer Relations Team, ask questions, and receive additional support regarding PartnerLink, menu items, new website features, and more. Please come prepared with questions and examples of issues that you may be experiencing with PartnerLink. Sharing your experiences is valuable, as it could help others facing similar issues. If you have specific recurring issues unique to your organization, we may need to take down your information and set up a one-on-one meeting to address them thoroughly and ensure the office hours are productive for all partners. Please note that if there are no attendees in the first 15 minutes of the office hours, we will cancel that week's session. To register for Customer Relations office hours, please click . We appreciate your ongoing partnership, collaboration, and look forward to seeing you at one of our training sessions or during our office hours. Thank you, The Customer Relations Team
