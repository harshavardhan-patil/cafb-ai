The deadline on our grant (FY24 MD Region MOCO 1-H) for $3,097.61 is May 27, 2024. When we tried to enter an order to use up that grant there were no delivery times available before May 27, because of the holiday weekend. We spoke with Charity in Partner Support and she told us to submit our order with a May 28 delivery day and then email you to get the deadline extended by a day.

In addition to extending the deadline, please have your finance department deduct the order from the above mentioned grant. The computer automatically deducted it from our next MOCO grant which expires in June.

I apologize for causing you extra work. Thank you for your assistance. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions.

Hello - We have not received our Grocery to Go Order as of 2:30 pm. It was supposed to be delivered by 2:00 pm. Please advise. If it is not coming a robo call needs to go out so all the seniors do not show up.

Good morning Partners, 
 
 We hope this message finds you well. Today, February 12th 2025, the Capital Area Food Bank is operating solely in an administrative capacity, and there will be no deliveries or pickups due to the current weather conditions. 
 
 For partners who have orders scheduled for tomorrow or Friday, we plan to operate under normal conditions. However, if you anticipate that your agency will be closed due to the weather, please reach out to Customer Relations as soon as possible to discuss rescheduling your order at partnersupport@capitalareafoodbank.org or 202-644-9845. 
 
 Additionally, even if your site remains open, we require confirmation that your location has been safely plowed and salted to allow for safe deliveries. If a driver arrives at your site and finds it is not adequately prepared, please be aware that your agency may incur a restocking fee. Our delivery equipment cannot navigate through snow or ice safely, and we prioritize the safety of both our drivers and your staff. 
 
 We appreciate your cooperation and understanding as we work together to ensure everyone's safety during this weather event. We are actively monitoring the situation and will keep you updated with any changes regarding our operations for the rest of the week.
 
 Thank you for your partnership. Stay safe and warm!
 
 Best regards, 
 Customer Relations  {quote}

The partner did not receive the order today, but he received an email yesterday saying the delivery was attempted yesterday.

{color:#500050}Hi -




I did not see on the home page about Juneteenth, but I am assuming that is why the order is closed now. Can we make an adjustment? Can you remove the:

 

825043 Mangos CASE 10lbs 1/10 lbs Case (x 20 cases)

 

We realized late that we put a pallet (want to keep) in as well. 

 

Thanks{color}

[CAUTION: This email originated from outside of the organization. Do not click links or open attachments unless you recognize the sender and know the content is safe]   

Good morning, Partners, 


 We hope this message finds you well. We are reaching out to address the challenges posed by the inclement weather we have experienced over the past couple of days. Unfortunately, this has left us two days behind in our pulling schedule, which has led us to make the difficult decision to cancel the orders originally scheduled for Wednesday, January 8th. 

We sincerely regret any inconvenience this may cause to your distribution plans. We understand how vital these deliveries are to your operations.  *We encourage you to respond to this email and let us know whether you would like to finalize the cancellation of your order or reschedule it.*  Please note that we will need a response from your agency by the end of the business day ( *5 pm*) on  *January 7th*, or the order will be canceled on our end. 


 Please note that we are rescheduling orders, with the earliest openings being mid-week next week. This is due to our delivery and pickup schedules being full before the snow we experienced this week. Please reach out to us to coordinate further!
 We are fully aware of the impact that inclement weather can have on our collective efforts, and we remain committed to ensuring the safety of our staff and yours during this time. Thank you for your understanding and support as we navigate this situation together. We are working quickly to get back on schedule.

Good afternoon, _x000D_
I am confused regarding the shopping process. We were under the impression that when we select items for delivery and they are saved and confirmed in our cart, those items are guaranteed to be delivered. These items were placed and saved in our cart a little over 2 weeks ago. So please help me to understand how this happens, and more so without the offer of a replacement. _x000D_

I appreciate that you are ramping up the number of food items you are offering. Do you expect to have spaghetti noodles available anytime soon? It hasnâ€™t been available for weeks and our clients are asking about it.  Thanks

Hi,_x000D_
_x000D_
I picked up an order for Annandale UMC this morning in Lorton and discovered upon unloading that I was given the wrong item. I had ordered six cases of canned black beans and instead received six cases of canned pinto beans. I realize it is partially my fault for not checking before loading the vehicle and I probably would have noticed had I been asked to sign for receipt, but I wasnâ€™t._x000D_
_x000D_
Ideally, Iâ€™d like to exchange the beans the next time I pick up an order. Iâ€™m not sure if that will be before the new year._x000D_
_x000D_
Thank you,_x000D_

Hi Alanna and Sharon, 

  

Greetings. We continue to appreciate the product received from the Produce Hub. Just FYI, we did discard a couple boxes of cantaloupes and some potatoes from the delivery yesterday. 

  

Thanks.

Good Evening Partners,

We would like to inform you that the Capital Area Food Bank will be closed on Tuesday, January 7th, 2025, due to inclement weather. On this day, there will be no pickups or deliveries, and any scheduled orders will be rescheduled once we reopen.

Please note that Customer Relations will also be closed on that day. All tickets and phone calls will be addressed upon our reopening when we will process rescheduling and cancellations. We will provide an update regarding our status for Wednesday later on Tuesday.

Stay safe and warm.

Thank you, 
Customer Relations{quote}

Can you tell me the expiration dates on the donated items in my order? There were many items without pictures so it's difficult to know if they are appropriate for my site as well. I don't know the weight or size of each item.{adf}{"type":"expand","content":[{"type":"paragraph","content":[{"type":"text","text":"Cindy Lucas, Food Pantry Director"}]}],"attrs":{"title":"Signature"}}{adf}
END OF TICKET
Partner called Partner Support to ask that their two upcoming pickups are combined into one delivery order due to the total weight of the orders being larger than what they can accommodate. Partner has a preferred delivery date of Friday due to their scheduled Saturday distribution. I explained that with both orders being locked, this may be difficult to accommodate as our delivery calendar is full until Monday 9/23.

{color:#172B4D} Do we provide refunds for expired items that were purchased? I know donated items are typically past their date but this was a purchased item. The PO I saw also said the expiration date is 11/30/24 so not sure if that being incorrect should also warrant a refund. Let me know!{color}

{color:#172B4D}Hello,{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}  
  
{color:#172B4D} Of late, I am not getting a phone call letting me know that the driver is on their way to our Pantry. I enter a note for each of our orders asking that a driver call as they are leaving the warehouse so that our volunteers have enough time to get to our location when the truck arrives.{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}   
  
{color:#172B4D} We are a small organization - and our Pantry is just that - a large closet that stores a tremendous amount of food. We deliver our food to the clients so there is no 'office' available for volunteers to wait.{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}  
  
{color:#172B4D} When I scheduled today's delivery, a morning slot was not available. I had written asking if there would be any way to move our delivery up since we are normally an early delivery partner. I was told that the delivery schedule was full for the morning so that I had to keep my noon - 2 pm slot.{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}  
  
{color:#172B4D} I happened to be at the Pantry to do some stocking and the truck arrived at 10 AM!{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}  
  
{color:#172B4D} Luckily we were able to meet the driver with no delay to his schedule.{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}  
  
{color:#172B4D} I would appreciate it if drivers could please view the special notes/instructions for each delivery. I have been told by a few drivers that they do not see the special notes on their delivery receipt.{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}

{color:#172B4D} Our order (SO187548) arrived on Wednesday at 10:30 am. The order was scheduled to arrive between 12 - 2 pm. I did not receive a call.{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}   
  
{color:#172B4D} Of late, I have not been receiving calls from the driver letting me know that they have left the warehouse.{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}  
  
{color:#172B4D} Our Pantry is VERY small (but mighty). My volunteers that help unload the pallets do not arrive until I let them know the truck's ETA. So if a driver doesn't call, I may not be at the Pantry to receive it.{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}  
  
{color:#172B4D} Will is a great driver - so I did not say anything about not giving me a call on Wednesday - I happen to be at the Pantry so he was able to drop off my 2 pallets earlier than scheduled.{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}  
  
{color:#172B4D} My next order (1/8/2025) is again scheduled for a 12 - 2 pm delivery... though I would rather have a morning delivery appointment. Can my order please be moved?{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}

Good morning, Partners, 


 We hope this message finds you well. We are reaching out to address the challenges posed by the inclement weather we have experienced over the past couple of days. Unfortunately, this has left us two days behind in our pulling schedule, which has led us to make the difficult decision to cancel the orders originally scheduled for Wednesday, January 8th. 

We sincerely regret any inconvenience this may cause to your distribution plans. We understand how vital these deliveries are to your operations.  *We encourage you to respond to this email and let us know whether you would like to finalize the cancellation of your order or reschedule it.*  Please note that we will need a response from your agency by the end of the business day ( *5 pm*) on  *January 7th*, or the order will be canceled on our end. 


 Please note that we are rescheduling orders, with the earliest openings being mid-week next week. This is due to our delivery and pickup schedules being full before the snow we experienced this week. Please reach out to us to coordinate further!
 We are fully aware of the impact that inclement weather can have on our collective efforts, and we remain committed to ensuring the safety of our staff and yours during this time. Thank you for your understanding and support as we navigate this situation together. We are working quickly to get back on schedule.

{color:#172B4D} Hello Alanna,{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}  
  
{color:#172B4D} This is Than from BPSOS. I am writing this to let you know about an issue with our food delivery this morning 11/15.{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}  
  
{color:#172B4D} We ordered a total of 8 or 9 pallets of vegetables this morning. However, those pallets were stacked on top of each other as a pair when they were delivered. We asked the driver if he could bring the pallets down since they are very heavy (about 800 lbs each) and our office did not have any equipment to handle that.

{color:#172B4D} We did have this issue in the past and it took our staff (which comprised of many seniors) a tremendous amount of effort to handle it. We always appreciate CAFB for providing the food for free, but in the future, it would be great if you do not stack pallets on top of each other. If you have no choice but to do so, please let us know in advance.{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}

{color:#172B4D} Hello Alanna,{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}  
  
{color:#172B4D} Happy Monday! This is Than from BPSOS. I am writing this because we encountered a technical issue on the website. Last Friday 11/22, we tried to add a few items, namely 2 of the  *800908 Cabbage, Green Local 675# BIN 1/675 lbs Bin* into our cart, to be delivered this Wednesday 11/27. However, it said that those items were not available on that selected date, but in the item description, it said that it will still be available until 12/10. As a result, we could not select those items back then. It was pretty late then, so I was not able to email you until today.{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}  
  
{color:#172B4D} I know that we may past the deadline for edit order; however, is it possible for you to remove all of the "300597 Turkey Breast, 6-9# Basted w/ Gravy Packet 1/30.42486 lbs Case" from our cart, and replace them with 2 of the "800908 Cabbage, Green Local 675# BIN 1/675 lbs Bin?" Additionally, do we still need to order more than 1000 lbs to be eligible for delivery?{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}  
  
{color:#172B4D} I know that we are asking a lot Alanna, but we want to make sure that our vulnerable and underserved population can enjoy a good Thanksgiving this week. We would appreciate a lot if you can help us.{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}

Good afternoon and happy new year,

I just booked deliveries at both locations for 1/7. This was a mistake. Could we please cancel those orders? I forgot we already had orders built for 1/6.

We do not need another delivery at both locations on 1/7.

Thank you!

Good Afternoon Partner Support Team,  

  

Karen informed me a few minutes ago that Bull Runâ€™s order for today SO186597 was not delivered because we only had 2 drivers in Virginia to make deliveries. Karen has confirmed with the partner that they can accept the delivery tomorrow morning. I have moved the appointment to tomorrow in NetSuite so that it can be routed with tomorrowâ€™s orders. I will also send an outlook invitation out as a reminder. I wanted to let you all know as well so we can ensure that the issue is properly tracked.  

  

Please let me know if further information is needed at this time. Thank you!

HI- 

My apologies that I did not attend the mandatory training for updating the hours on Partner link. 

I did not realize that there was a training (not sure if I missed an email). 

I see that the deadline to update the hours is Oct. 1. 

Is there some written instructions that I could follow or can I set up a time to get a quick training? 

Again, my apologies for missing this. 

  

Thanks,

{color:#172B4D}Good afternoon,{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}  
  
{color:#172B4D} I wanted to follow up with you all regarding the issue with Capital Christian Fellowship's produce hub earlier this week. CCF adds food and edits the SO I make for their produce hubs. In the past few months, they have added thousands of pounds of food to these orders, making them close to 40k pounds sometimes. For the most recent hub order, someone at CCF accidentally removed 3k pounds of produce meant for the produce hub. Christ let me know that this can happen since the produce is marked as available for agencies and CAFB staff.{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}  
  
{color:#172B4D} We are having a meeting tomorrow with CCF to discuss the produce hub orders. I wanted to reach out to you all to get your insight on whether it would be beneficial for Transportation/Ops if I told CCF  that  *they cannot add/modify*  produce hub SOs anymore. However, I wouldn't want CCF to create additional orders during the same time and further strain the capacity of Transportation/Ops. If there is a specific pound limit that I should tell them not to exceed when adding food to the produce hub SOs, I can do that as well.{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}   
  
{color:#172B4D} I know that the produce limitations will impact their ordering, so their order sizes will probably decrease in the next few months. Please let me know if there is anything you would like me to mention during the meeting tomorrow. Thank you again for all your help!{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}

Good afternoon CAFB,

I hope your week is off to a good start!
It is Capital Christian Fellowship. We have to cancel our orders SO176185 (for Tuesday, September 24) and SO176188 (for Wednesday, September 25) because we have a repair to our Parking lot that needs to be fixed and we cannot receive any delivery!
Is it possible to carry over the items from SO176185 to our order for Tuesday, October 1 (SO177213) and the one from SO176188 to our order for Wednesday, October 2 (SO177245).
If this is possible, it would be so great!
I look forward to your response!

Thank you in advance!

Be blessed!

Good afternoon CAFB,


I hope you had a great weekend!
I am trying to complete my purchase but can't and the following message appears "We are currently processing your order, until we have finished processing you will not be able to complete more orders". I would like to know if it is because of the pound limitation that we are receiving this message. If yes, I would like to let you know that we have not yet exceeded our pound limit.

Thank you in advance for your answer!

Be blessed!

Good afternoon CAFB, 

I hope your day has started well!

We have a delivery this morning (SO177245) but I think the driver made a mistake: we received 4 BINs of sweet potatoes instead of 2 BINs of sweet potatoes and 2 BINs of apples. Is it possible to have apples today?

Good morning CAFB,

Yesterday I emailed you that we had not received the corn. Just to let you know that we saw the boxes of corn. In fact, the boxes were under several boxes of beans and this did not allow us to easily locate them.

I would also like to inform you that among the beans, we found a large number of severely dented canned beans that we had to throw away since we cannot offer them to our guests.

Have a blessed day.

I hope your day is going wonderfully!

So far, I have not yet seen the truck for the Delivery Hub. He was supposed to be here since 8 a.m. and now it's 10 a.m. Will the truck come? If yes at what time? I need this information because of the partners who will come to collect their product.

Thank you in advance for your answer.

Hi CAFB team,

I hope my email finds you well.

It is Capital Christian Fellowship. 

We received part of our order early this afternoon and the driver said there is another truck coming. Can I know what time the truck will be here? I have volunteers who are currently working on making packages and I would like to know if I should tell them to wait a little longer or to come back tomorrow.

Thank you in advance for your answer!

We had ordered 6 pallets of onions last week to be delivered today but they were not among the produces delivered this afternoon. Will you deliver them tomorrow with our delivery of milk and eggs?

Good morning,  

  

Do you think the request not to stack could be adhered to? If so, I will put a note on their future produce hub orders. I am not sure who to loop in from ops, so please feel free to loop them in as needed.  

  

Thank you,  

Augusta

  *Subject:* Produce Hub Request  

   

Hi Augusta,
 
 I hope my email finds you well.
 
 I have a request about the Produce Hub: is it possible that the pallets of produce are not stacked on top of each other? SEED comes with a truck like the one from CAFB so it uses the pallet jack to pick up their produce but when the pallets are stacked on top of each other, we have no way to lower the pallet of produce which is on top which we forced to cut the cardboard, to extract the product into a bin so that another partner can have its product. If the pallets come individually, each organization has the possibility of collecting its pallet of produce to its truck.  

    

Also I looked at the order for the Hub but I only saw 50 squash boxes instead of 176 (the 58 boxes are the ones I ordered for my distribution). Will the rest be added later?   

    

Thank you Augusta

Good morning CAFB team,

I hope my email finds you well. The form to make the request is no longer available which is why I am sending you this email.


CAFB has given our Food pantry a limit of 16,250 pounds per month but we would be grateful if we could have a very higher produce allocation otherwise our distribution will be in trouble. The first reason is that each week we have over 500 guests at our Food distribution (several times we have already exceeded 600 guests!) and the number is only increasing. We have 4 distributions in a month. 16,250 pounds per month is 8 pallets per month. We cannot feed more than 500 people per week with only 8 pallets per month so we will be forced to reduce our distribution to 1 day per month instead of 4 per month. 8 pallets is the minimum number of pallets of food we use for a single distribution in the month. If you look at our order history, for the past several months we have been doing 2 orders per week, one on Tuesday and one on Wednesday in order to have enough produce for all the families that come. 

The second reason is that CAFB is our only food supplier. If you maintain the limit of 16,250 pounds per month, the question for us will be: how are we going to get the difference in food that we will no longer have? Having no other suppliers, the only solution will still be to reduce the distribution days. 

The third reason is that we do not make our choices based on the pound because we have the space in our Gym to store at least 40 pallets against the wall, if they are pallets stored one on top of the other, that makes us more than 80 and we can also store 12 pallets in our Food pantry room so we have plenty of space to store the food. We make our choices taking into account the diversity of food because of the diversity of cultures who come to take the food. 

I hope that all these explanations will make us find favor in your eyes so that you increase our pound limit.


Thank you in advance.

Be blessed!

Good morning CAFB,


I hope my email finds you well!

I sent you yesterday an email about a message that appears on your site while placing orders but I did not receive an answer yet. 
The message says â€œYou are required to verify all your hours of operation records before 10/1/2024 or your account will be locked.â€
What hours of operation must be recorded? I don't really understand this message.

Thank you in advance for the explanation.


Also in our October 1st order (SO176185), there is item 100773 Good Culture Probiotic Whole Milk which needs to be refrigerated. Is it possible for it to be delivered with our other orders on Wednesday, which is our distribution day? This will save us the storage problem.
Thank you in advance.



Be blessed!

Good afternoon Team CAFB,


Hope you had a great Thanksgiving!

We have a concern about the milk that will be delivered to us on Wednesday, December 4 (SO184675). Is it possible that for this time, the amount will be reduced to  *80 cases* instead of 108. 
The reason is that at our last milk distribution, we noticed that our guests were very careful about the best by/expiration date and we had milk that was left over. This was not a problem at that time because we were able to keep them in the refrigerator until the following food distribution.
But, we have the same leftover milk, we do not have enough space in the refrigerator at the moment to keep them and we do not want to waste food. This is why we want to be careful.

Thank you in advance for your understanding.

Have a blessed day!

Hi there, 

Due to a staffing change on our end for 8/16, we'll need to postpone delivery for the pending order SO170984. How do we proceed from here to change the delivery to the following week? 

Thanks!

Hello, 

I just spoke with Ms. Burks about the $75 delivery charge on invoice 171178. Her entire order consisted of free produce. Although a grant wasn't used, all items, except the cantaloupe, were categorized as MD TEFAP. 

Could you please review and confirm whether the cantaloupe was placed in the correct category and if the delivery fee is accurate? If the charge is valid, would it be possible to reach out to Austin to inquire about waiving the fee? Following that, could we update Ms. Burks on the outcome? 

Unfortunately, Friday is my last day before maternity leave, so I won't be able to handle the follow-up myself. 

Thank you for your assistance. 

   

 Thank you,  

 Angel

Good afternoon,  


  

As we begin our TEFAP program, we are wondering if we can place orders for TEFAP food as well as our regular food distribution and have them delivered on the same day? 


  

Our goal is to have the TEFAP food on one order and regular food distribution items on another so that when delivered, it is easy for our team to store in the appropriate space.

Good afternoon, Partners,

We hope you are all doing well. As many of you may know, snowy weather conditions are expected today. The latest forecast indicates that snow will likely begin this afternoon, so we currently plan for all orders scheduled for Tuesday, February 11th, to proceed as originally scheduled.

The most significant weather impact is anticipated on Wednesday, February 12th. As a result, we will be rescheduling or canceling orders for that day in preparation. We encourage partners with orders scheduled for Wednesday to proactively reach out to us at [partnersupport@capitalareafoodbank.org|mailto:partnersupport@capitalareafoodbank.org] or 202-644-9845 to discuss potential rescheduling. This will help us manage any challenges related to the expected snowfall.  *Please note that delivery dates for Wednesday orders have temporarily been changed to February 28th until we can confirm new delivery dates with each partner.*

For partners with orders scheduled for the rest of the week, including Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday, we appreciate your communication regarding any plans to delay or cancel your orders. Effective communication is crucial for prioritizing the safety of both our team and yours. Together, we can navigate this snowy weather safely and efficiently.

We will keep you updated on any final decisions made by our Operations and Leadership Teams regarding delays or closures.

Thank you for your understanding and partnership. If you have any questions or concerns, please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out.

Best regards, 
Customer Relations

Hi CiArra,

If there is any way we can get our delivery yet this week, that would be needed, since our big distribution is this Saturday, rain or shine. If absolutely necessary, we can figure out how to come and pick it up.

Blessings,
-Phil-

Dear Sir or Madam,

When our guys returned from picking up our order from the Lorton warehouse this morning (Order #SO177250), we discovered that several items were missing from the order. I am guessing one pallet was forgotten.

 

The following items were not received:

 

300015 Macaroni and Cheese (4 cases)

300247 Vegetable Oil (29 Cases)

300256 Corn Flour (5 cases)

 

Could you please see if that pallet can be located? 

 

Thanks so much!

 

Blessings,

-Phil-

Good morning Lisa,  

  

Did you communicate these errors to CAFB Partner Support on 12/3/2024? If not, I recommend doing so in the future at the time when you figure out any errors with an order. The Parter Support team members are wizards and can fix almost anything related to PartnerLink or deliveries! I am CCing them on this email to start a help ticket for [SO186461|https://229676.app.netsuite.com/app/accounting/transactions/salesord.nl?id=8365563].  

  

As I understand it, you have been overcharged for several items because you didnâ€™t actually receive the number of cases reflected on the Sales Order (Spaghetti, black beans, milk). [@Partner Support|mailto:partnersupport@capitalareafoodbank.org] could you all please process a refund for these items?  

  

Regarding the  +extra+ cases delivered, I am not an expert on what to do, so Iâ€™ll let Partner Support weigh in.  

  

Thank you!

The tables below show the errors in December's delivery. You can also see the delivery ticket attached where I made note of the actual number of boxes received of items we ordered, as well as extra items we received.    

    

We assume that there was just a mix-up of the pallets upon unloading of the truck.

 *CHEER December 3, 2024 CAFB delivery* | | | |

I hope this helps.    

    

Will our account balance remain at $2,132.72, based on the original order?    

    

Thank you,

Hello,


I hope this message finds you well. I am excited to announce the Children of Mine Youth Center has welcomed Nicole Lloyd as our new Community Outreach and Food Distribution Coordinator. 


To ensure Nicole can effectively contribute to our programs, it is vital that she undergoes training with the Food Bank. This training will equip her with the necessary knowledge and resources to assist in our food distribution and community outreach program.


Could you please add Nicole to the schedule for the next available training session? 


Please let me know if you have any questions or need further information. Your assistance in this process is greatly appreciated.
I've added this message to our organization's letterhead. See attachment.

Have a wonderful week!

Hi Maria,  

  

Thank you for reaching out about these issues with your order. Iâ€™m adding [@Partner Support|mailto:partnersupport@capitalareafoodbank.org] on this email so that they can decide how best to proceed.  

  

Donâ€™t ever hesitate to reach out about incorrect orders, even if itâ€™s just a minor mistake. We want to be sure our inventory is always correct, so it helps to have partners let us know when weâ€™ve made a mistake.  

  

Thanks,

{color:#172B4D}Hello Joanna,{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}   

    

{color:#172B4D}I just came back from vacation yesterday and was looking over our inventory to compose our guidelines for this week and noticed that the chicken that we received on Friday was not the TEFAP chicken that we had ordered for pick up on 11/08.{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}    

    

{color:#172B4D}It's on our team for not checking properly the case size and weight but the chicken which we received was the following:{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}    

    

{color:#172B4D}300595 Chicken Leg Quarters, Halal 5# Chicken Leg Quarters, Halal 5# 6/5 lbs Bag{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}    

    

{color:#172B4D}We received 9 cases of the above chicken. I knew it wasn't correct based on the count and the fact that it was halal. I believe this is a purchase item through the CAFB website and wanted to check with you and the team to see how you would like to proceed.{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}    

    

{color:#172B4D}As a side note, on a past order we received 6 cases of TEFAP red kidney beans instead we had ordered 6 cases of TEFAP pears which was a minor problem and explained the importance of checking the order with our team prior to accepting.{color}

{color:#172B4D} Passing this along directly to you as we have received quite a few complaints about the canned peaches. Did you ever hear back from the Warehouse about if they have been able to check the rest of the boxes? Also are you all able to connect with Emily directly about her refund request?{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}

We received a delivery of food on Tuesday, February 18. Everything was fine except for one case of peaches. 17 cans out of 24 in the case were damaged. I have pictures below. The cans with the black spots are holes where the juice leaked out. The two cans on paper had leaked and were stuck to the paper. You can see all the cans that were wet. We cannot give out food that is stained like this; plus, we have no way of knowing if the contents are bad. We could use only 7 cans from this box. Since prices are so much higher now and our money is tighter, we would like a refund. 
  
I have not heard anything about the cans of pears that were damaged a few weeks ago. 
  
Have a good week. Emily

Ideally it would have been earlier but due to the days events I could not get to the task of ordering and therefore was relegated to that time slot. My questions is since we also receive an order from the Mobile Market that day which is normally at 8:00 am is it possible to have both orders on the same truck in the morning versus bringing two trucks to the same location?

Good afternoon Partners, 

If you are receiving this email, it means you have not yet attended one of our mandatory Hours of Operations Trainings. There is a new feature available on PartnerLink that allows partners to update their hours of operations for their distributions. This feature will enable you to keep your records up to date as required, which is important for ensuring that we have the most current information in our internal systems for our clients to use. 

Once approved, the information collected from your updates will be linked to our online tool that clients can use to find food assistance: [Get Help Map|https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/find-food-assistance/]. 

To ensure that all partners understand how to use this function, we have hosted three trainings, and there is one session remaining on  {color:#e03e2d}*September 19th from 9 am to 10 am*.{color} These sessions have been designed to demonstrate how to use this feature and provide an opportunity to speak to our team about PartnerLink and offer feedback.

Once you fill out the form entirely, a Zoom link with a calendar invite will be sent to your email.

Item 700719 says it has a quantity of 6 available for delivery by 12/20, but when I tried to add 1 to our 12/20 order (SO187635), the system then said 0 was available. Can you please clarify whether there are any 700719 pallets available to deliver 12/20?

I'm trying to edit order SO188814 today, but the system is telling me it's closed. I realize this is probably because CAFB is closed tomorrow through next Thursday, but is it really necessary to close a January 3 so soon?

Below is the list of produce items from your order *SO189320*:

Hi,


Our monthly produce limit for weekly orders was confirmed last week to be 2,000 lbs. We had been alerted in October about the new limit and that our limit might be that amount.

Now that this has been confirmed, can you share whether this 2,000 lb limit is an across-the-board limit for all partners, or does it vary according to some measure such as dollars spent or persons served?

Thank you.

Hi,


I have SO185617 set up for delivery 12/6/24 and I'm trying to increase the amount of brown rice (300005) and black beans (300049), both of which the system tell me have units of stock, for example, the system says there are 711 units brown rice available on or before 12/12/24. But whenever I increase brown rice from 20 units to 30 units, I get an error message.

Should I be able to increase brown rice to 30 units and black beans to 30 units?

Hello,


We are currently picking up donations at Safeway 3250 on King Street in Alexandria every Thursday.
Our volunteer and backup volunteer will all be out of commission for the next few months.
Please offer our pickup day to another organization.
I let the receiver know that our last pick up will be on Thursday, May 30th and that I was passing on this information to you.
When our volunteers are back, I will reach out to you to see if there are any available stores.

Does CAFB assist with grants for transportation for food pantries? We are in need of a cargo van to transport food to our clients located in senior buildings and also to provide food on an emergency basis, which requires transporting the food to the client. If not able, can you provide resources and grant opportunities that cover non-profit organizations and transportation? 

Thank you,

Good afternoon Partners, 

If you are receiving this email, it means you have not yet attended one of our mandatory Hours of Operations Trainings. There is a new feature available on PartnerLink that allows partners to update their hours of operations for their distributions. This feature will enable you to keep your records up to date as required, which is important for ensuring that we have the most current information in our internal systems for our clients to use. 

Once approved, the information collected from your updates will be linked to our online tool that clients can use to find food assistance: [Get Help Map|https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/find-food-assistance/]. 

To ensure that all partners understand how to use this function, we have hosted three trainings, and there is one session remaining on  {color:#e03e2d}*September 19th from 9 am to 10 am*{color}{color:#e03e2d}.{color} These sessions have been designed to demonstrate how to use this feature and provide an opportunity to speak to our team about PartnerLink and offer feedback. Please note that this training is mandatory. You can use this link to [register |https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=4eNCVd-_qki8SMWEhD1eIsYv8jPOqcdPqqy5Ip3OhsZUN1ZKWjFLWk5EV1NHOUFSSjFLUUtaQ1E3OS4u]your agency. Once you fill out the form entirely, a Zoom link with a calendar invite will be sent to your email. We only require one representative per agency to attend, but we encourage all shoppers who have access to PartnerLink to join. We suggest that this person work closely with the food program and have a deep understanding of operations. 

While the training will be recorded and slides will be shared, all partners are expected to attend the live (online) training to meet the requirement. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact Customer Relations. 

Thank you,

Good morning, Partners, 


We hope this message finds you well. We are reaching out to address the challenges posed by the inclement weather we have experienced over the past couple of days. Unfortunately, this has left us two days behind in our pulling schedule, which has led us to make the difficult decision to cancel the orders originally scheduled for Wednesday, January 8th. 

We sincerely regret any inconvenience this may cause to your distribution plans. We understand how vital these deliveries are to your operations.  *We encourage you to respond to this email and let us know whether you would like to finalize the cancellation of your order or reschedule it.*  Please note that we will need a response from your agency by the end of the business day ( *5 pm*) on  *January 7th*, or the order will be canceled on our end. 


Please note that we are rescheduling orders, with the earliest openings being mid-week next week. This is due to our delivery and pickup schedules being full before the snow we experienced this week. Please reach out to us to coordinate further!
We are fully aware of the impact that inclement weather can have on our collective efforts, and we remain committed to ensuring the safety of our staff and yours during this time. Thank you for your understanding and support as we navigate this situation together. We are working quickly to get back on schedule. 


Warm regards,

Dear Partners, 

  

We hope this message finds you well. We are reaching out to you today because we have discovered a system error that mistakenly marked Tuesday, May 28th as Memorial Day instead of Monday, May 27th. As a result, some of you were able to place an order for that day. We apologize for any confusion this may have caused.  

  

Please be advised that on the actual day of Memorial Day - Monday, May 27th - Capital Area Food Bank will be closed. Because of this, we will need to move the day of your delivery to ensure that you receive your order on a different day that works with your schedule.  

  

In order to make this change as quickly as possible, please respond to this message at your earliest convenience with the most convenient day for your delivery. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding. 

  

Thank you for your patience and cooperation. 

  

Sincerely,

Hello, this inquiry relates to maintaining inventory reports for food delivery and distribution at the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Woodbridge, Virginia. After reviewing the records, we received an order on September 27, 2024, and only received a copy of the delivery sheet page one. However, on the page it is note as page one of two. We did not observe a page two. We would like a copy of page two for our inventory records. IF it is possible an emailed copy would be helpful. 

Also, the delivery reports for September 27, 2024, and October 25, 2024, document the delivery of item 540184 (VA-TEFAP Canned, Beef Stew 24oz 24.24oz Case. Both deliveries were not cans of beef stew but beef stew pouches (item 540073). Our inquiry is for having the correct item numbers and product listed on our inventory reports. 

If you can respond to this email message with a copy of the page two delivery document for the delivery September 27, 224 and share instructions for coding the inventory reports regarding the Beef stew (cans versus pouches) for the months of September and October, it would be appreciated. 

Your assistance is appreciated.

Hello,

We are from Ebenezer Church of God and when placing our orders ever since the change to the app with the pounds reduction we had difficulties with viewing and placing orders. The order screen continues to Flicker all the time as we try to make selections to add to our cart.

We're asking your IT department to please assist and look at it .

Lucy Paredes was at our center yesterday to do a site visit and we also showed her what is does.

Thanks very much and Have a Bless and Merry Christmas

Hello, my name is Pamela Sturdivant from Faith United Ministries #4830-01.
My issue is I have an order being delivered on 3-3-2025, and items we needed
just became available today (2-24-2025). I went ahead and set up a delivery of
the items but it requested a new delivery date and to pay an additional delivery fee.
The new invoice is #SO197349. I wanted to know if this ordered can be added to
my previous order.
Thank you,

Dear partner support coordinator, we at FBC Ken-Gar have grant allocations from 3 different grants, 2 of the expires in 30 days and the third expires in June. When we order food the funds are taken out of the grant that expires later. Is there any way that you could take the money from the accounts that expire first. It would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

Good morning.

FISH of Laurel is so very happy to receive this $6006.85 grant as it has been many years since we have received a grant from CAFB!

I have a question about invoice #194073 (this orderÂ #SO192982 was received on 2/13; it was originally scheduled for delivery on 2/10, but there was a problem that day and the driver failed to arrive during the 8:00-10:00 AM delivery window).

On 2/14, we received the following email:

{color:#ff5630}Dear FISH of Laurel, Inc.,{color}

{color:#ff5630}We are delighted to inform you that your organization has been awardedÂ grantÂ funding to support your efforts in addressing food security in our community.Â {color}{color:#ff5630}*$6,006.85*{color}{color:#ff5630}Â has been awarded to your organization under the new food creditÂ grantÂ â€“Â FY25 Maryland DHSÂ and the funds were made available in your account onÂ Monday,Â February 10th, 2025. Partner food credits can be used by your organization toÂ purchaseÂ grantÂ eligible items using CAFBâ€™s Partner Link Menu.Â Â {color}

{color:#ff5630}Your partner food creditÂ grantÂ deadline is May 15th, 2025. Please remember that the food creditÂ grantÂ deadline is applied to the delivery or pick up scheduled date, not the date you placed the order. CAFB reserves the right to change deadlines and to reallocate and/or extendÂ grantÂ deadlines based on partner usage to ensure contract requirements are being met. If your organization cannot use the fullÂ grantÂ amount before the deadline, please tell us as soon as possible.Â Â Â Â Â {color}{color:#fff0b3}Â {color}

Are you able to apply the grant to this order? I believe that a number of items on this order are grant designated.

We received our order today and we received 5 and not 6 cases of chicken pouches (#300342). Please update our invoice.

Thanks.

Please see the photo I uploaded. When we received this masa harina, there was clearly a rodent bite taken out of one of the 10 bags in that package. I would like a partial refund for the damaged bag. Also, a mouse was under the palette that the driver dropped off! I guess he was busy snacking during the ride to our location.



Thanks.

Hi Austin, 

  

We processed a return authorization for SO189343 due to the weather conditions, since the reason is weather related should we include the $75.00 shipping fee when processing the return?

Thanks, Lauren   

If it's the same one I got from Zaynab (spelling??) Then I haven't been getting them.    

    

The only mobile distribution request was from you when we met. Nothing before that. It most likely went to Carrie.    

    

Erin, I look forward to hearing from you.   

    

Thanks,   

Eric

Hi Lauren,   

I'm returning from the holidays and the snow . We are in transition and as you may know Carrie is no longer with FLCC/Crowder Owens Food Bank. As I work my way through a lot of backend stuff I now have access to. I also need access to the portal to place orders, do reports etc., . Can you assist me with that?   

    

Thanks,   

Eric

Hi Alanna - It was good to see you today. As Donna mentioned, our agency contact info is changing. Donna and I will continue to be the day-to-day contacts and need to receive copies of any and all communications from CAFB to ensure you get any necessary response from Floris.  

  
Shell Lewis, the Director of Serve Ministries, will vacate her role next week. The position had not yet been filled.  
  
Allan Ballenger has retired as the Executive Director. As of yesterday, Barbara Miner (bminer@florisumc.org) is now our Executive Pastor. Though she will probably be the one who signs the partner agreement, she has no involvement in the day to day operation of our food distribution program and would prefer not to receive routine emails from CAFB.  
  
If you need us to complete a form, please let me know.  
  
Thanks!

{color:#172B4D}Good morning. I notice that the June early closure and blackout dates are published on Partnerlink - thank you! July 4 falls on Thursday this year. Will the food bank be closed just on July 4, or will there also be service interruptions on the 5th? There've also been some summer shut-downs for staff activities in the past; are any of those on the horizon? It's really helpful to know those dates as far in advance as practical.{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}

Hello,

Thank you for reaching out. If the order could be rescheduled to a time later this week that would be great. We are having a pantry this Saturday and we are running low on oil, produce and meats as this is part of the order. Iâ€™m actually out of town this his week so could you please reach out to Christian Pfeffer-Kleemann, his number is +1 (507) 316-4048. I also included him in the distribution list of this email. 

If there is no option to reschedule for this week, can you please reschedule the order to January 24th 10 a.m.? In this case please remove the produce from the order if you canâ€™t hold it safely at the food bank. 

Thank you for your support of our community 
Dominic

Greetings!

Some items that were ordered on SO157319 were not given to Food For All at CAFB today. We were not given the expected frozen pallet which should have contained pulled pork, pork loin roast and wild blueberries. And we did not receive the order of eggs.

Can these items be added to SO158094 on 5/8/2024?

Thanks,

Peter

I saw that there is one opening from 8-10 on 12/19. I tried to change the time of delivery order SO187625 from 12-2 to 8-10 on 12/19, but could not figure out how to do it. So, please change the time of SO187625 from 12-2 to 8-10 on 12/19. Thanks.

Hi Austin, 

  

We processed a return authorization for SO189298 due to the weather conditions, since the reason is weather related should we include the $75.00 shipping fee when processing the return?

Good Afternoon,

I was looking over my upcoming orders. Somehow I did not place an order for 6/28/24. I wanted to check and see if there was any way we could place an order. This is the last week before we go on our summer vacation for two weeks and we wanted to be able to distribute that day.

Please let me know if we can be added. Anytime slot would be greatly appreciated.

Hi All,  

  

We just got a report from a Virginia partner, Food For Others, that masa flour they received from us on 8/6 had weevils in it. Please see order details below: 
* SO#: SO170804
* Item Code: 300256 Corn Flour, Masa Harina Minsa
 

  

  

Have we received this report from other VA partners? Can we check the remaining supply we have to ensure it is weevil free?  

  

Thank you!  

  

Best,  

Riley{color:#4E8227}{color}

Hi Riley,  

  

I hate to bother you with such a pesky problem but the Maseca we purchased on 8/6/2024 has a weevil infestation. I wanted you to be aware but I also want to make sure the remaining Maseca on the menu is pest free. We will need to replace our stock, should I find another source temporarily?

We would like to add additional grapes to our order if they are available.  It was difficult to determine how many actual bags of grapes would be delivered.  The description is not very clear.  If possible weâ€™d like to add an additional 20 cases (8 bags per case) to this order.  Also, if there will be other produce added weâ€™d like to have that added such as potatoes regular or sweet and any other items available.  We serve 375 families and weâ€™d like to provide adequate produce for them.  The distribution is this coming Saturday, Oct 26th.  Thank you in advance for any assistance you can provide.
END OF TICKET
The items being requested appear on the shopping list but, not available for our delivery date.  Weâ€™d really like to have these produce items.  Please let me know if these items will be added to our order or if other produce may be available to add.

We are concerned about snow in the forecast causing our delivery to be cancelled on Thursday, 2/20/25. Are you able to change the delivery to Tuesday, 2/18/25,  or Wednesday, 2/19/25 of this week? Friday, 2/21/25 delivery would also work. If none of those times are possible, Thursday, 2/27/25 is the least desireable alternative. Your effort in helping us provide food to our neighbors is much appreciated.

Good morning, Partners, 


We hope this message finds you well. We are reaching out to address the challenges posed by the inclement weather we have experienced over the past couple of days. Unfortunately, this has left us two days behind in our pulling schedule, which has led us to make the difficult decision to cancel the orders originally scheduled for Wednesday, January 8th. 

We sincerely regret any inconvenience this may cause to your distribution plans. We understand how vital these deliveries are to your operations.  *We encourage you to respond to this email and let us know whether you would like to finalize the cancellation of your order or reschedule it.*  Please note that we will need a response from your agency by the end of the business day ( *5 pm*) on  *January 7th*, or the order will be canceled on our end. 


Please note that we are rescheduling orders, with the earliest openings being mid-week next week. This is due to our delivery and pickup schedules being full before the snow we experienced this week. Please reach out to us to coordinate further!
We are fully aware of the impact that inclement weather can have on our collective efforts, and we remain committed to ensuring the safety of our staff and yours during this time. Thank you for your understanding and support as we navigate this situation together. We are working quickly to get back on schedule. 


Warm regards,

I inadvertently canceled my order for May 13 delivery. I thought that I was just cancelling the edit request I was looking to add. Can it be restored? There are no open delivery slots. Gaithersburg Community Soup Kitchen had a 12 - 2 delivery time slot.

Thank you for your help.

Normally we get an order delivered on Friday for a Sunday distribution. There were no delivery options available for Friday 06-14-24. So I placed an order for 06-13-24. If a Friday delivery opens up on 06-14-24, will I be able to have the order shifted to that date.

I ordered a delivery of TEFAP only items for delivery on 06-26-24. There was a $75 delivery charge included. Is this a new policy? I know that a delivery fee was included for non-TEFAP items. 


Please confirm if this is a new policy or a computer glitch.

Ms. Jackson,
Gaithersburg HELP is an all-volunteer organization that has been serving the needy in our local community for 56 years, and we are dedicated to supporting as many families with food each month as we can. In fact, last month HELP served 500 families at our pantry in the Festival Shopping Center. We have only a couple of volunteer drivers who can deliver food, and we must reserve that service for those individuals who live alone or have a partner who also can't drive to the pantry. You had asked for us to deliver food to a family of 9 people. As you must know from your previous food pickups, which total 30 since 2018, we pack according to family size; so a family of 9 would receive at least 8 heavy bags of groceries. We simply can't ask a volunteer, all of whom tend to be over 60 years of age, to pick up and deliver many bags of groceries; and that would not be appropriate when there are able-bodied family members in residence. As an all-volunteer organization, we strive to serve as many families as possible; but we can sustain our operation only if almost all of our families pick up at the pantry. If a client needs to come to the pantry via bus, we offer bus tokens so that transportation to and from the pantry is free. 

It is not an insult to let someone know that we have limited capabilities for food delivery. It's just a fact. And we would not ask to see proof of disability. We explain our limited delivery ability to any client who asks about delivery. Also, our coordinators always provide information about how to get food from Manna and/or the Gaithersburg Hope Center. Clients can get food from us while also getting food from those other organizations. In that way, we hope clients find they have more money to apply toward rent or utility bills. Our yearly client survey results validate that outcome and that our volunteers treat clients with dignity and promptness. 

We could serve your family very quickly with food if someone could drive to the pantry or come via bus. 

Margo

Dear Capital Area Food Bank Support Team,



My name is Yvette Jackson, and I am writing to report an issue I experienced with food assistance delivery from Gaithersburg HELP.

On Monday at 9:36 a.m., I called to apply for food assistance delivery, but my request was refused based on the number of people in my household and our ages. Specifically, this refusal has caused significant inconveniences and insult to my family and me, as we urgently need food assistance. Insulting my family by indicating "With such a large family someone should be able to take the bus here for pick up!" shows a lack of empathy and compassion. After making a complaint, I received a response at 12:54 p.m. today, indicating that the refusal and statement were correct due to the volunteer nature of the service and their inability to deliver help to a large household. I was directed to seek assistance from other sources such as Manna Food.

I believe there might be a misunderstanding or miscommunication regarding our eligibility for this service. Attached to this email, you will find documentation of my disability for your review. Please note the MetroAccess document on line 16, which indicates that my disability prevents me from independently using the accessible Metrobus and Metrorail system for all trips. I am unable to walk due to L spine disease with a risk of falls, panic attacks, anxiety, and non-tolerance to crowds. At this point, I feel my disability, age, and household circumstances are severely limiting my access to essential help.

I would appreciate your assistance in reviewing this matter and providing any necessary support to ensure that my household can receive the food assistance we need as it appears Gaithersburg Help is not completely meeting the needs of the community. I value your prompt attention to this issue and look forward to your response.

{color:#172B4D}Hi,{color}  
{color:#172B4D} A partner reached out re: SO187723 they ordered item 520088, which is listed as "MD TEFAP Plums Pitted + Dried," but received bags labeled "prunes." The first picture is the one listed on NetSuite and Partner link, and the second picture is of the product she received.

Good morning,

I have a question on items from two previous orders 
From SO161546 (6/7/24):
We ordered salad dressing 111043. The items had assorted dates that had best by dates past 6 months or more. Are they OK since the majority of them are cream based?

!IMG_20240617_083143.jpg|thumbnail!


From SO163161 (6/14/24):

I had asked for best by dates for items but the dates on the reply email did not match the items we received except for 1. Are the dates sent on the email the best until dates: 100856 - Hot fries, 100854 - Glutino bars, 100858 - Caramel Popcorn? The best by dates are important to us because it tells us how much to order if we want to keep items for future distributions.

Thank you 

Sincerely,
Andrea

Hello,

Is it possible to have the quality checked on item 822096 Kale? The last time we ordered kale, most of the leaves were yellow, over 50% of it. However we were not able to check the item before the driver left. We ended up weeding through the boxes for greener leaves. 

Thank you.

Sincerely,
Andrea

Good morning,
This past Friday, we received 3 produce items that should not have been delivered especially the mustard greens. This is from SO180219.
The the mustard greens was already breaking down and gave off a terrible smell. Both the yellow summer squash and strawberry only 50% usable. The yellow squash looked like it was frozen and then defrosted with some molds. The strawberries were moldy. Both items did not look like they had significant issues from initial inspection. It is only when you start taking them out really looking carefully that you would notice the quality issues. I do not have pictures of the strawberries but I do have pictures of the mustard greens and the yellow summer squash. They are attached below.

Good afternoon,

Our delivery for Friday, June 21, has already been closed and I am unable to edit the order. I do not understand why it has been closed to early without notice. It usually closes after 5pm or even later. I need to do a final edit and I would appreciate if you would allow me to remove some items. 

Thank you.

Sincerely,
Andrea

Hello,

i just saw that item 100757 was removed from our delivery tomorrow. It is a pallet of meals to go that we were going to offer our clients as back to school choice. We were planning giving at least 2-3 per family. Right now we are going to end up giving 1 per family. It is disappointing. I dropped the other individual cases and decided on a pallet thinking that surely CAFB knows how many full pallets they have of an item since it is large and there are only 15 posted (at least when I initially saw it). It is even more disappointing because every week it seems as though an item is being removed from our order. This week it is a full pallet of meals to go. Last week it was 6 cases of eggs, and 3 weeks ago a bin or corn. 

I thought that when the number of items get posted to Partner Link, these are the number of items available to order. I am trying to understand why the items are missing by the time items get pulled. And it should not be happening almost every week. I have the same pallet ordered for delivery date 8/23. Am I going to assume that item is also gone since the same item is now not available or missing? 

We appreciate what you all do but there is always room for improvement. 

Thank you for your time and help.

Sincerely,
Andrea

Good morning,

Last week I had sent a message asking about a handbook on rules and regulations available online. 
I was told that it is still in progress. We are wondering what are CAFB guidelines regarding volunteers and CAFB food. Do they need to sign up to receive food or is this left up to the individual partners to set these guidelines?

Thank you. 

Have a blessed week,
Andrea

Good morning,

This past Friday the delivery driver told one of our Pastors that he can't wait until 10 am and the pastor had to receive the order. The pastor said he went ahead and received the order because of what the driver told him but was concerned that our full order may not be there because he is unfamiliar with the receiving process. Our delivery window is 10 am-12 pm. I spoke with the driver around 9:30 and I told I will be there a little before 10 but he was gone by the time I arrived. 

Also, is it possible have the best by dates for the items below, additional info, and for pictures for some of them:
100826 Best by date, how many in one case/box
100818 Best by date, how many in a case/box
100837 Best by date
100833 Best by date and picture

Good morning, Partners, 


We hope this message finds you well. We are reaching out to address the challenges posed by the inclement weather we have experienced over the past couple of days. Unfortunately, this has left us two days behind in our pulling schedule, which has led us to make the difficult decision to cancel the orders originally scheduled for Wednesday, January 8th. 

We sincerely regret any inconvenience this may cause to your distribution plans. We understand how vital these deliveries are to your operations.  *We encourage you to respond to this email and let us know whether you would like to finalize the cancellation of your order or reschedule it.*  Please note that we will need a response from your agency by the end of the business day ( *5 pm*) on  *January 7th*, or the order will be canceled on our end. 


Please note that we are rescheduling orders, with the earliest openings being mid-week next week. This is due to our delivery and pickup schedules being full before the snow we experienced this week. Please reach out to us to coordinate further!
We are fully aware of the impact that inclement weather can have on our collective efforts, and we remain committed to ensuring the safety of our staff and yours during this time. Thank you for your understanding and support as we navigate this situation together. We are working quickly to get back on schedule. 


Warm regards,

If not, we need it delivered with our order coming on 2/19. #[{color:#dc7a00}SO195608{color}|https://linkprotect.cudasvc.com/url?a=https%3a%2f%2forderva.capitalareafoodbank.org%2f%23&c=E,1,8NwwLJiDWtqaRxCvs9vTqZlx75PIUXvrHeYuwb1z8ctThozrBr1cRfG-Gm1UGPqoYSaOa89ta9ckCYjWCQqoEJi5BNTThlnuXflJ31_0SSE,&typo=1]{color:#dc7a00}{color}
Could you let me know the status so I can arrange to have volunteers to assist?
Thanks so much,

Good morning, 
I have not been able to order many of our regular items for several weeks or months and find less and less items being available. These include canned tomatoes and corn, white rice, and different varieties of cereal. This morning I see that deliveries beginning the week of July 29 are not available but have yet to see an announcement. I just want to plan ahead if the move into the new warehouse is happening that week and adjust my order for 7/24 before that window closes. 
Thanks for your assistance,

Hi Partner Support,

We were told that cases of fresh vegetables would be available some time ago. They are never available when we're placing our orders. So, does that mean they are really never going to be available anymore for small sites with no dock availabilty?

We have not been able to pick up fresh vegetables since Covid began and in-house shopping was discontinued.

Your positive response would be appreciated.

This has been a recurring problem over the last few orders.  I place orders via INVOICE - not via credit card.  However, when I go to edit a pending order, the EDIT button is greyed out with a notation about editing not possible with credit card orders.  The order information shows it was placed via INVOICE.   

I donâ€™t know if this is an issue only for our organization.  Alanna had offered that perhaps the problem is caused by the credit card listed in the database for us (although not used for the order).  

It is very helpful to review the menu while an order is pending to be able to add any needed items that were not on the menu at the time of placing the order.

I request attention to this problem so that we may again have the ability to edit our pending orders as needed.

Your assistance on this matter is greatly appreciated!

Thank you

Good afternoon Partners, 

If you are receiving this email, it means you have not yet attended one of our mandatory Hours of Operations Trainings. There is a new feature available on PartnerLink that allows partners to update their hours of operations for their distributions. This feature will enable you to keep your records up to date as required, which is important for ensuring that we have the most current information in our internal systems for our clients to use. 

Once approved, the information collected from your updates will be linked to our online tool that clients can use to find food assistance: [Get Help Map|https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/find-food-assistance/]. 

To ensure that all partners understand how to use this function, we have hosted three trainings, and there is one session remaining on  {color:#e03e2d}*September 19th from 9 am to 10 am*{color}{color:#e03e2d}.{color} These sessions have been designed to demonstrate how to use this feature and provide an opportunity to speak to our team about PartnerLink and offer feedback. Please note that this training is mandatory. You can use this link to [register |https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=4eNCVd-_qki8SMWEhD1eIsYv8jPOqcdPqqy5Ip3OhsZUN1ZKWjFLWk5EV1NHOUFSSjFLUUtaQ1E3OS4u]your agency. Once you fill out the form entirely, a Zoom link with a calendar invite will be sent to your email. We only require one representative per agency to attend, but we encourage all shoppers who have access to PartnerLink to join. We suggest that this person work closely with the food program and have a deep understanding of operations. 

While the training will be recorded and slides will be shared, all partners are expected to attend the live (online) training to meet the requirement. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact Customer Relations. 

Thank you,

Good morning,


My agency is limited to 1200 pounds of produce per month. We are doing our distribution twice a month and for the month of December I noticed that much of the produce was by pallet, even the mixed produce. Are you considering making those into smaller bins for those who are limited to less than 2000 lbs?

Thank you! For any of your direct distribution programs, like the family markets, do you do any notifications to individuals who received a product that was part of a recall? Thatâ€™s one thing we are trying to determine as part of our process â€“ if we should notify patients.

{color:#172B4D}Hi Kate,{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}   

    

{color:#172B4D}Thank you for reaching out about this! While the Good Samaritan Law does protect food pantries and food banks from civil liability, we do still monitor the FDA recall announcements to ensure the safety of our clients. Please see CAFB's recall policy below. In addition to this, I am not sure of other healthcare providers who may have a policy in place for this. Gillian may be able to provide support there!{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}   

    

{color:#172B4D}Let me know if I can help with anything else!{color}

{color:#172B4D}Food Recall Policy:{color}   

{color:#172B4D}A food recall, as defined by the FDA, involves removing foods from the market that violate the regulations set by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Foods are recalled for various reasons, primarily due to contamination or failure to disclose essential allergens on the product label. It's important for food suppliers and distributors to stay informed about recalls, as consuming recalled foods may lead to illness or injury. If a product is recalled, the details will be specific to the item reflecting the brand, product name, freeze-by date, and other relevant information pertaining to that specific product. Items that do not match the description provided in the recall notice are not affected and can be safely consumed. In the event of a recall, it is recommended to return the product to the place of purchase or dispose of it to prevent consumption.{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}  

  

{color:#172B4D}The Capital Area Food Bank constantly monitors FDA food recall notifications and maintains regular contact with vendors and suppliers. In the event that we are made aware of a recalled inventory item, we will take immediate steps to remove it from all upcoming orders and notify our partners who may have received the item since it was added to our menu. Our Customer Service Team will use various communication channels to promptly inform all partners about the recall and the necessary steps to take with the product.{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}  

  

{color:#172B4D}If you have received an item from Capital Area Food Bank that you suspect has caused illness, please contact Customer Relations immediately. Provide your contact information, the date and time of the distribution where the food was distributed to clients, a description of the issue with the product, the item number/name, the date you received the product from our warehouse, and any illness or injury resulting from consuming the item. The Customer Relations Team will handle your complaint seriously and alert the relevant teams at Capital Area Food Bank to address the issue promptly.{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}  

  

{color:#172B4D}If you have any questions about this process, please contact{color} [{color:#172B4D}partnersupport@capitalareafoodbank.org{color}|mailto:partnersupport@capitalareafoodbank.org]{color:#172B4D} or 202-644-9845.{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}{color:#4E8227}{color}

  *Subject:* Quick Question{color}   

    
  

Good afternoon! 

  

We are creating an internal process for handling food recalls for our food programs. To inform this process, Iâ€™m hoping to learn from others doing this work. Do you know any healthcare systems/providers that have on-site pantries, and if so, can you connect me?  

  

Also, from what I understand food banks/pantries donâ€™t do any notifications for recalls due to the Good Samaritan law. However, I want to make sure Iâ€™m correct â€“ does CAFB do anything for recalls, i.e. notifying pantries who received affected food?  

  

Thanks, 

Kate

Good morning Ms. Brown,   

    

I hope you're having a great week so far. I will no longer be employed at the International High School at Largo as of July 1st. I would like to give a colleague access to the online ordering system and share the new point of contact with you. Can you let me know what forms are required to change the contact information for the partnership?   

    

While my school works to hire my successor, the point of contact will be the Assistant Principal, Juan Villao. Please let me know what is needed to switch the information and give him and the School Social Worker access to online ordering.   

    

    

    

Regards,

Hi All, 

  

Our partner John S. Mulholland Foundation shared his experience picking up SO176182 yesterday. Can we look into what contributed to the delays here? Iâ€™ve followed up with the partner to assess his arrival time, and will update when I hear back. Thanks! 

  

Best, 

Laura

Hi All,  

I hope this message finds you well. I have a delivery currently scheduled for Tuesday, December 24th, and I would like to inquire if itâ€™s possible to reschedule it to Monday, December 23rd instead.

Good Morning James and Mike,  

  

Marian Johns from Koinonia just called the NOVA Main Line to notify us that the person who was supposed to pick up their order today (SO185565) had an emergency and is unable to make it. They are hoping to pick up the order at 8am tomorrow, instead. Is that okay with you all? I can change the appointment in the system if so, but please let me know if anything else is needed.  

  

Thank you!

Does that mean that we wonâ€™t be able to make our 8am pick up? That would have been nice to know sooner than 10 minutes before the pick up time. Our driver is already almost there. Do we have to come back in two hours?

Hi Partner Support Team,  

  

I noticed that Santa Maria ordered a few TEFAP produce items in excess. The SO is SO175172. Would you mind please reaching out to the site coordinator to verify the quantities of peaches, plums, and nectarines? We do not believe they have the capacity to distribute 100s of cases of these items at their distribution.   

  

Thank you!

Greetings, 


We attempted to change the delivery date on order #S0191890 which is scheduled for Monday, February 3rd, however, the date was locked today. 


We would like to cancel the Monday delivery date, and instead, we would like to merge that order with order # S0193072 which is scheduled for Tuesday, February 4th. 


We hope that this can also be only one delivery fee. Please let us know if this is possible.

Hello, 
Please change the payment method for the sale order SO187759 from credit card to invoice. 
I believe there's a problem with your ordering system. Even when I selected "Invoice", I am unable to edit because the payment method is credit card. 
Review the attached photos.

{color:#172B4D}Dear Partner Support,{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}  
  
{color:#172B4D} Last Friday, 2/14/25, sale order SO194429 was delivered to our location. It included 3 bins of cereal, item 100862. At first sight, we noticed rodent droppings on top of cereal boxes in one of those bins. That bin was not accepted and the delivery driver loaded it back up inside his truck.{color} 
 {color:#172B4D}The other two bins were b{color} {color:#b36ae2}*r*{color}{color:#172B4D}ought upstairs to our storage room. To our surprise, a few minutes later, we saw a mouse coming out of one bin and returning inside that bin.{color} 
{color:#172B4D} We had to act quickly since other food items were stored inside this room. We immediately wrapped both bins, loaded them inside our vehicle and drove to two landfill sites to dispatch the two open bins with donated assorted cereal. Upon dispatching them, our staff saw two mice. This confirmed our fear that more than one mouse had entered inside our building and our storage room through the open bin cereals that we ordered.{color} 
{color:#172B4D} Of course, the issue was not over and the following Monday, 2/17/25, we caught another mouse. We will continue to closely monitor our storage room and other areas to be certain that the problem has been eradicated. Attached are pictures of what was left behind after we removed the two bins out of the storage room.{color} 
{color:#172B4D} This experience was very disturbing, and a solution needs to be implemented quickly. This put us behind schedule by four days due to the intervention that we put in place. We also had to throw away our products that the mice had contaminated.{color}  
{color:#172B4D} CAFB has been such a great partner to us and we are forever grateful for the 'all in' support that you have been providing us to allow us to help our underserved communities. That is why we are sharing this information and our experience to you so this can be further looked at and hopefully avoided. We are in this together to strengthen food security, so we know this kind of issue will be attended to and taken seriously by both parties.{color} 
{color:#172B4D} We look forward to your feedback or resolution around this matter.{color} 
 {color:#b36ae2}{color}

Dear Partners, 

  

We hope this message finds you well. We are reaching out to you today because we have discovered a system error that mistakenly marked Tuesday, May 28th as Memorial Day instead of Monday, May 27th. As a result, some of you were able to place an order for that day. We apologize for any confusion this may have caused.  

  

Please be advised that on the actual day of Memorial Day - Monday, May 27th - Capital Area Food Bank will be closed. Because of this, we will need to move the day of your delivery to ensure that you receive your order on a different day that works with your schedule.  

  

In order to make this change as quickly as possible, please respond to this message at your earliest convenience with the most convenient day for your delivery. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding. 

  

Thank you for your patience and cooperation. 

  

Sincerely,

Good morning Augusta,   

I'm hoping you are well. I needed to make some changes to my order yesterday but unfortunately I forgot that Monday was a holiday and the order was already locked.   

My request,(see below), was denied because the order was already fulfilled.    

Would you please help me in that matter?   

If it is impossible to reduce the amounts of some of the items, then can you remove the only frozen item, 520388 chicken leg quarters {color:#172B4D}, in order SO174321?{color}   

Thank you for your assistance.   

    

Best Regards,

Hello, I need support adding some products to SO187759. I am trying to backorder two items, 520332 Whole Chicken - 40 cases and 520035 Oil - 100 cases to this order but when I go to hit save this message pops up â€œ [229676.app.netsuite.com|http://229676.app.netsuite.com] saysThis sales order has both terms and a payment method set. When this is the case, payment method takes precedent, and a cash sale will be generated upon billing. To instead create an invoice, remove the payment.â€ I did not want to mess up any of the payment or order so I stopped and put in this ticket. Thank you!

Hi Augusta,   

    

We got a delivery from CAFB this week with various items. There were a few mice openings in our corn meal bags. We just wanted to let you all know and be aware. We were able to keep a majority of the bags, but had to get rid of a few. If there is someone else I should notify, please let me know.

Good morning Pastor Samantha,  

  

Thanks for reaching out, Iâ€™m so happy to hear everything is going well! I went into your Sales Order and added a bin of corn to ensure youâ€™d get some (produce tends to disappear quickly).  

  

I am looping in our Partner Support team to answer your  *billing questions (in bold below*) â€“ theyâ€™re the experts on all things â€œSales Orderâ€ and I would recommend saving their information for future reference as well. I also attached a contact book for any other questions that might arise that are outside my prevue.

Hi Augusta,   

    

I hope this email finds you well. Things have been going really well for us the last few weeks for our pantry! We made a purchase last week in hopes to add on produce this week. However, this morning when I went to go add on produce *, I got the notice that I cannot edit the order if we paid with a credit card*.  *Could you let me know more about this issue and how we can proceed in the future? Can we only add produce to our order later if we get an invoice?*    

    

We are really hoping to get that bin of corn if possible! Thanks!

Good Morning, 

  

We had an order Friday where we only received a partial delivery of what we ordered. We received everything except for the full pallet of pasta we had on our order. It was a 500 box count of the tri-color pasta (penne and rotini I believe). Any help in this situation would be greatly appreciated.

Good afternoon Partners, 

If you are receiving this email, it means you have not yet attended one of our mandatory Hours of Operations Trainings. There is a new feature available on PartnerLink that allows partners to update their hours of operations for their distributions. This feature will enable you to keep your records up to date as required, which is important for ensuring that we have the most current information in our internal systems for our clients to use. 

Once approved, the information collected from your updates will be linked to our online tool that clients can use to find food assistance: [Get Help Map|https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/find-food-assistance/]. 

To ensure that all partners understand how to use this function, we have hosted three trainings, and there is one session remaining on  {color:#e03e2d}*September 19th from 9 am to 10 am*{color}{color:#e03e2d}.{color} These sessions have been designed to demonstrate how to use this feature and provide an opportunity to speak to our team about PartnerLink and offer feedback. Please note that this training is mandatory. You can use this link to [register |https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=4eNCVd-_qki8SMWEhD1eIsYv8jPOqcdPqqy5Ip3OhsZUN1ZKWjFLWk5EV1NHOUFSSjFLUUtaQ1E3OS4u]your agency. Once you fill out the form entirely, a Zoom link with a calendar invite will be sent to your email. We only require one representative per agency to attend, but we encourage all shoppers who have access to PartnerLink to join. We suggest that this person work closely with the food program and have a deep understanding of operations. 

While the training will be recorded and slides will be shared, all partners are expected to attend the live (online) training to meet the requirement. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact Customer Relations. 

Thank you,

Hello everyone, 

  

It is unclear if this should go to you Erin, as I think this is a DC partner (Mary House), or to the Partner Support team as she mentions a â€œmandatory hours of operation trainingâ€. Please let me know if either of you can assist this partner. Thank you.

We have a stack of pallets behind the church near the dumpsters.  Would you please schedule a pickup?

We are getting a delivery of produce next week, but I donâ€™t know if they will have room on the truck.

Hi, I am expecting a delivery on Monday January 6th, and there is snow in the forecast.  I was hoping to review your inclement weather policies, and the link sends me to 2024 Holidays.pdf.

Would you please let me know what will happen if it snows and what do I need to do?  

Thank you and Happy New Year!

Not sure if this is helpful, but our first choice to reschedule delivery would be this Friday, January 10, 8-10 AM for order #SO189117. 

 

Also, we have a pickup order #SO190150 scheduled for this Wednesday. Would it be possible to include that order whenever we get the delivery of the other order?

 

Thank you!

Hello, I just happened to notice that my upcoming order (SO189117) only has 27 of the 38 cases of peanut butter (#300010) that I ordered.  When do you expect to get more peanut butter in?  In the future, can you let me know if Iâ€™m not going to get the full amount of what I originally ordered so that I can make other arrangements?  Thank you so much for all youâ€™re doing!  I know youâ€™re all super busy right now!

Lucy that is not a problem as majority of clients eat non halal. The issue is that we donâ€™t have that much space to freeze it at this time. I have ordered chicken also on the menu which is coming 17th. We wonâ€™t be able to handle additional chicken. 

My apologies please remove extra Tefap chicken order that you have added on. Rice and oil are good. 

Many thanks

{color:#172B4D} Like stated in my pervious email, there were 40 cases of the whole frozen chicken, and 50 cases of the oil added to your SO. The chicken and oil added are TEFAP items, please only distribute to TEFAP eligible participants.{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}

[Hi there,|] 

  

I am looking for guidance on food expiration dates. While I have the one-sheet on food coding, there isnâ€™t really a category for the highly processed items (oreos, triscuts, etc) and juices (non refrigeration ones) that we just received from a donation that are past their expiration date. Can you offer advice on how long past their expiration dates it is OK to distribute these items? 

  

Thanks,
 Julia

Hello Joanna. Hope you are well. I thought I did not have a food order for tomorrow and I see we do have. I did one order for 5/16. Which may be too much. Can you add it to the order of 5/21. Or can be talk to see what I need to do. Thanks so much. Best, Matilde

 Hello, 

  

 I am reaching out because VDACS has provided us with  *new TEFAP income guidelines*, to be used immediately. Please print the attached document and begin using it to determine client eligibility. 

  

 If you are using Link2Feed or Service Insights, it will take a few days for the new income guidelines to be updated within those systems. Please print a copy of the new guidelines and refer to them if the system tells you that a client is ineligible based on income. Itâ€™s possible that under the new guidelines, they actually are eligible. If that happens, go ahead and mark the person as eligible, even if the system is suggesting that they are not. This should not be an issue for too long. 

  

 Please let me know if you have any questions! 

  

 Best,
 Joanna

The delivery was made today by Mr. Ebenezer. However, he refused to pick up the empty pallets. Heâ€™s the first driver who has not done this on the day of delivery. Could you please send someone to pick them up? Our space is very limited, and we donâ€™t have room for the empty pallets of last week.

I am the Treasurer of Mother of Light Center in Alexandria.   Annually, I download all of the CAFB invoices and use them for accounting purposes.  For the year July 1, 2023 to June 30, 2024 I was only able to find about 50% of the invoices on the CAFB web site.   Several months were missing all invoices.  Do you know why this might be the case and if there is a better way to obtain the full universe of invoices for the period July 2023 - June 2024?

Thanks!

| {color:#172B4D}Good morning partners,{color} | 
| â€Š | 
| {color:#172B4D}We are thrilled to announce that on August 5th, we will be launching a new feature on PartnerLink. This feature will enable partners to update their Hours of Operations for your distributions. This new feature is very exciting because it means that you will be able to update your records whenever necessary. This ensures that we have the most up-to-date information in our internal systems and for clients to utilize. As a reminder, once approved, the information we gather from your updates will be linked to the information provided in our online tool that clients can use to locate food assistance: {color}[{color:#172B4D}Get Help Map.{color}|https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/find-food-assistance/]{color:#172B4D}{color} | 
| â€Š | 
| {color:#172B4D}To ensure that all partners understand how to utilize this function, we will host four training sessions: two in August and two in September. These sessions are designed to demonstrate how to use this feature and also provide an opportunity to talk to our team about PartnerLink and provide feedback. Please note that this training is  *+mandatory+*. You can use the links below to register your agency. We only require one representative per agency to attend, but we welcome and encourage all shoppers who have access to PartnerLink to join. We recommend that this person work closely with the food program and has a deep understanding of operations. While the training will be recorded and slides will be shared,  *all partners are expected to attend the live training to fulfill the requirements*. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact Customer Relations.{color} |

Upon selecting a training date and completing the form, you will receive the corresponding Zoom link via email.{color} | 
| â€Š | 
| {color:#172B4D}We are also excited to announce that the Customer Relations team will be hosting office hours every Wednesday in August and September from 10 am to 11 am starting August 14th. If you have any questions or support needs related to the new PartnerLink feature, this time is available to you.{color} | 
| â€Š | 
| {color:#172B4D}Additionally, this opportunity will allow partners to interact with the Customer Relations Team, ask questions, and receive additional support regarding PartnerLink, menu items, new website features, and more. Please come prepared with questions and examples of issues that you may be experiencing with PartnerLink. Sharing your experiences is valuable, as it could help others facing similar issues. If you have specific recurring issues unique to your organization, we may need to take down your information and set up a one-on-one meeting to address them thoroughly and ensure the office hours are productive for all partners. Please note that if there are no attendees in the first 15 minutes of the office hours, we will cancel that week's session.{color} |

Good day 
Muslim Community center has been getting fresh fruit and vegetables boxes for about two years . 
Recently we learned that MCC was not selected to receive produce boxes for PY 2025. 
I am requesting some information as to how this decision was reached. As community members are asking about it.  
Any thing you can do to help will be certainly appreciated

Hi team, 

I hope you are doing well! I recently learned that partners are being charged for orders that are mixed TEFAP and non-TEFAP. I double checked with the states, and no cost can be associated with TEFAP, even if there are other items included. Can you please remove the associated charge, and let me know if you have questions or concerns before moving forward. 

Austin, just including you as an FYI. 

Thanks!

I contacted you about 2 months ago about items needed by our pantry that are no longer on your menu.   We need shelf stable milk 8oz size bottled water, applesauce/fruit cups 4oz,  individual cereal bowls, granola bars, juice boxes, tuna pouches 2oz,  can soups.   I have checked everyday and nothing.  We have had to resort to costco and bjâ€™s and even with that our shelves are sparse and our numbers of clients have increased.  Is there any help coming or should we continue to look for other resources of help.  Help is really needed.

Thanks in advance

Hi,

When I sign into my account, it looks like I only have access to Villages of East River. I need access to Washington View, our newest site. If possible, I would also like to gain access to our other NHT sites: Galen Terrace, R St., and Mass Place Apartments.

Thanks!

Good evening, I received an email from Lucy Paredes regarding information needed by 5pm today. Unfortunately, I am unable to make this deadline. I've tried to reach her by phone, and it goes to voicemail all day. I've responded to her email and she has not responded back. 

Most of the emails appear to have threatening tones. I would like to speak with someone regarding our TEFAP account.

Thank you

Lucy, First, let me thank you and the TEFAP program for allowing us to serve. We have been a part of the Capital Area Food Bank since 2009, that's 15 years of service. The volunteers that come to work with us do so at the kindness of their heart. Our Community is mult-cultural. People who are afraid of the impact of completing the form. At the Civil Rights meeting, I asked the question of how we can educate the community to help them understand that they wouldn't lose their benefits by completing the form. By saying, you can't have food unless you fill out the form is heartbreaking. 

We are doing what we can, and to constantly be threatened of suspension is not a good feeling. I can't imagine any agency taking such steps over FOOD. These volunteers have worked tirelessly. If you need to come and get the foods we have, please feel free to do so. Let us know the date and time so that someone will be available. I spoke to Cynthia, and she informed me that  *NO TEFAP Food* was distributed in August. I will do the inventory, send you the forms we collected and that is all we can do. 

Best
Dr. Claudine Head

{color:#172B4D} Good Morning Dr. Head,{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}   
  
{color:#172B4D} I thought it would be best to answer on this email thread as you can more easily refer back to the Corrective Action Plan attached to the first email. I appreciate you sending along the pictures of the temperature logs and the civil rights training certificate. The Corrective Action Plan outlines 2 issues, the missing SDI forms and missing inventory reports.{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}   
  
 {color:#172B4D}The due date of 10/23/2024 was for the signed Corrective Action Plan to be emailed back to me along with a plan to prevent this issue from happening again in the future, please see the last bullet point below each issue, and lastly the missing inventory reports to be submitted. In your case, that is May and August of 2024. Like said in one of the emails below, if{color}{color:#172B4D} you submitted the missing months, you should have received an email with a PDF copy via email. If you could send me that, then it would clear up the missing inventory reports.{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}  
  
{color:#172B4D} Since I will be out of town tomorrow, Friday 10/25 and Monday 10/28, I will allow for one additional extension. The new date is Wednesday, October 30th, 2024. Please know that if these items are not submitted by end of day on October 30th, there will be a suspension placed on your TEFAP account. Any suspension that I do does not impact your ability to order regular CAFB food.{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}   
  
{color:#172B4D} To recap the final submission deadline for the signed CAP, summaries, and missing reports are due by End of Day, 5pm, on Wednesday October 30th.{color}{color:#172B4D}{color}

Good morning, Lucy, I plan to forward the certificate to you tomorrow. Also, the other person that was at the training, took the forms to make the certificates. We would not have been issued the certificate if we weren't there. There should be some accountability also on the facilitators part. I signed the form upon coming into the room.

Good evening Dr. Head,  

  

Below are some clarification points.  

  

Monthly Inventory Reports:   

I have attached what I am able to see on my end as far as submitted reports. If you submitted them, you should have received an email with a PDF copy via email. If you could send me that, then it would clear up the missing inventory reports.  

  

Civil Rights Training:  

I did remember talking with you however I did not see your name on the sign in sheets, see attached document for reference. If you could please let me know which day you attended (I believe it was the last one) then I can send you the PDF copy for you to sign and return.  

  

If you need any further clarification on either of the topics above, we can do a phone call tomorrow or Friday.  

  

Best,

Good afternoon Lucy, I'm not sure I understand. These surveys were completed already. I signed the roster when I came into the training. Also, the certificate is at the Church. You and I spoke at the training when you told me about the corrective action. We will sign the corrective action plan and send it back next week.

Dear Partners, 

  

We hope this message finds you well. We are reaching out to you today because we have discovered a system error that mistakenly marked Tuesday, May 28th as Memorial Day instead of Monday, May 27th. As a result, some of you were able to place an order for that day. We apologize for any confusion this may have caused.  

  

Please be advised that on the actual day of Memorial Day - Monday, May 27th - Capital Area Food Bank will be closed. Because of this, we will need to move the day of your delivery to ensure that you receive your order on a different day that works with your schedule.  

  

In order to make this change as quickly as possible, please respond to this message at your earliest convenience with the most convenient day for your delivery. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding. 

  

Thank you for your patience and cooperation. 

  

Sincerely,

Good Morning,


A few months ago, we were contacted about switching our distribution day from Tuesday to a later day in the week, and we agreed to move it to Wednesday. However, weâ€™ve found that having only one day between our distribution dates has been challenging for our volunteers and has created scheduling conflicts with some of our other pickups.

Now that the holidays are over, weâ€™d like to request switching back to our original Tuesday distribution. This change would allow us to serve the community more effectively and provide our volunteers with adequate time to recover between distributions.

We understand the importance of aligning with your delivery schedule and want to remain considerate of your operations. However, we would greatly appreciate it if this adjustment could be made. Please let us know if this is possible.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

Dear Partners, 

  

We hope this message finds you well. We are reaching out to you today because we have discovered a system error that mistakenly marked Tuesday, May 28th as Memorial Day instead of Monday, May 27th. As a result, some of you were able to place an order for that day. We apologize for any confusion this may have caused.  

  

Please be advised that on the actual day of Memorial Day - Monday, May 27th - Capital Area Food Bank will be closed. Because of this, we will need to move the day of your delivery to ensure that you receive your order on a different day that works with your schedule.  

  

In order to make this change as quickly as possible, please respond to this message at your earliest convenience with the most convenient day for your delivery. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding. 

  

Thank you for your patience and cooperation. 

  

Sincerely,

Hi - 

We received 1 - 825068 Cantaloupe FULL PALLET 72cs today. Sadly, we have gone through 40+ of the 72 cases (and going through more) 

and the cantaloupe is moldy, and spoiled. We are disappointed that we are not able to give to our clients and this was a very bountiful item. Attached are some images showing the issue. 

As we know we are not able to give out, we are asking and seeing if a truck can come to pick up to dispose. Having nearly 2600 pounds of spoiled food will dramatically take out our resources for disposing. 

Thank you in advance for your quick response to this matter.

- Chris

Good morning Chris,  

  

Iâ€™m looping in [@Partner Support|mailto:partnersupport@capitalareafoodbank.org] because theyâ€™re more clued into warehouse closures than I am and should be able to answer your questions thoroughly.  

  

I am currently looking into Coastal produce box delivery capacity during holidays / the limit of the funding we have for those.  

  

Thanks! 

  

Augusta

  *Subject:* November and December Delivery Dates  

   

Hi Augusta -   

    

Looking at the end of 2024 and wanted to check on delivery dates for planning purposes. 
*  Thanksgiving is Thursday, November 28th -- Will you have deliveries on Wednesday, November 27th?
*  Christmas is Wednesday, December 25th -- Will you have deliveries on Tuesday, December 24th?
*  New Year's Day is Wednesday, January 1st -- Will you have deliveries either Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday of that week?
  

Thanks   

    

- Chris

Today on our order we received some greens, but not all and we received 15 cases of bell peppers that were not on our order.

Trying best to describe and understand what these specific greens are. Only one of the boxes is labeled, but we are unsure.
* Image "CAFB NB What Is This? A" we have 20 cases and they are labeled as Flat Leaf Kale, but could be mustard, but maybe collards?
* Image "CAFB NB What Is This? B" we have 20 cases and think it might be mustards, but kinda looks like kale.
* Image "CAFB NB Flat Leaf Kale? But has Image A in it" 
* Image "CAFB NB Matches to Image B" is not labeled 


Thank you and please advise 

- Chris

Hi - 

Just checking to see if there were any issues with the carrots we received recently in the Coastal Proudce boxes with the recent E. coli outbreak/recall on them. I don't think they were from what we get, but just checking.

Thanks

Chris

Hi -


I just left a message on Augusta's VM and now emailing that we did not receive 1 of our 4 pallets today from Coastal Sunbelt Produce. The driver only had 3 on the truck. The order is for 320 Produce Boxes and we only received 240 Produce Boxes.

Please advise on if we will receive the 4th pallet today.

Thanks

Chris

Good morning.



This tuna is described as packed in water but itâ€™s actually mixed with soy protein. We are getting a lot of complaints about the quality, ranging from â€œitâ€™s disgustingâ€ to being an â€œinsult.â€

Please either stop offering it or at the least properly label it in the menu. We donâ€™t want to waste money on it. 



Thanks,

Judy

Good afternoon.

I believe a pallet from this order may have been left behind in the warehouse. We received 2 bins watermelon, 1 bin corn, 4 cases Halal chicken leg quarters, 20 boxes Corn Flakes and 5 sacks of lentils. The driver said he had 4 pallets for us, all of which we received.

I just checked again and these are the items that are missing:

5 sacks lentils

6 cases 8-oz milk

1 box assorted green vegetables

10 cases white rice

5 cases dried pinto beans

6 cases tuna

2 cases assorted soup

10 cases red lentil Jambalaya

I am sorry that I am late in reporting this. I had a series of meetings at work today.

Please advise what we can do.

Thanks,

Good morning. Could you please identify what kind of winter squash is in the bin? The butternut squash have been way too big for most of our families to handle.



Thanks,

Good afternoon. I sent a message on this yesterday via the portal but have not heard back.

Is it possible to find out whether the winter squash in Item No. 800107 is butternut or something smaller?

I just wanted to bring to your attention that the weight listed for two bulk produce items, potatoes/onions and cabbage, is doubled. The quantity of items is not doubled so it probably doesnâ€™t make a difference for this delivery, but it would in the future when CAFB initiates its rationing of produce.

Good morning, Partner Support.


I would like to cancel the 1/3/24 delivery since no produce came up on the menu before the ordering window closed (and I don't believe I received the usual message saying we have 24 hours to edit.)

Good afternoon Partners, 

If you are receiving this email, it means you have not yet attended one of our mandatory Hours of Operations Trainings. There is a new feature available on PartnerLink that allows partners to update their hours of operations for their distributions. This feature will enable you to keep your records up to date as required, which is important for ensuring that we have the most current information in our internal systems for our clients to use. 

Once approved, the information collected from your updates will be linked to our online tool that clients can use to find food assistance: [Get Help Map|https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/find-food-assistance/]. 

To ensure that all partners understand how to use this function, we have hosted three trainings, and there is one session remaining on  {color:#e03e2d}*September 19th from 9 am to 10 am*{color}{color:#e03e2d}.{color} These sessions have been designed to demonstrate how to use this feature and provide an opportunity to speak to our team about PartnerLink and offer feedback. Please note that this training is mandatory. You can use this link to [register |https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=4eNCVd-_qki8SMWEhD1eIsYv8jPOqcdPqqy5Ip3OhsZUN1ZKWjFLWk5EV1NHOUFSSjFLUUtaQ1E3OS4u]your agency. Once you fill out the form entirely, a Zoom link with a calendar invite will be sent to your email. We only require one representative per agency to attend, but we encourage all shoppers who have access to PartnerLink to join. We suggest that this person work closely with the food program and have a deep understanding of operations. 

While the training will be recorded and slides will be shared, all partners are expected to attend the live (online) training to meet the requirement. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact Customer Relations. 

Thank you, 

The Customer Relations Team

Alanna,  

  

Attached are pictures of insects that were found in the bags of corn flour we ordered to arrive last Monday, September 3, 2024. The volunteers had to clean off all the other bags and had to throw away 20 bags in the fight with the insects that were alive and fighting back. Is there a way for us to get a refund for the bags that we had to throw away? Of course we would prefer not to have cooties in our corn flour order so please keep those to the manufacturer to discard before sending (ha, ha ha). 

  

Thank you for your consideration,  


 Sally

Good morning, partners, 

We are excited to announce that the new PartnerLink feature is now live! This feature will allow partners to update their hours of operations for their distributions. This new feature is very exciting because it means that you will be able to update your records whenever necessary. This ensures that we have the most up-to-date information in our internal systems and for clients to utilize. As a reminder, once approved, the information we gather from your updates will be linked to the information provided in our online tool that clients can use to locate food assistance: [Get Help Map|https://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/find-food-assistance/]. 

To ensure that all partners understand how to utilize this function, we planned to host two trainings, two of which have already occurred and  *+two+* more in the month of September. These sessions are designed to demonstrate how to use this feature and also provide an opportunity to talk to our team about PartnerLink and provide feedback. Please note that this training is  *+mandatory+*. You can use the links below to register your agency. We only require one representative per agency to attend, but we welcome and encourage all shoppers who have access to PartnerLink to join. We recommend that this person work closely with the food program and has a deep understanding of operations. While the training will be recorded and slides will be shared,  *all partners are expected to attend the live training to fulfill the requirement*. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact Customer Relations. 

Please [click here|https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=4eNCVd-_qki8SMWEhD1eIsYv8jPOqcdPqqy5Ip3OhsZUN1ZKWjFLWk5EV1NHOUFSSjFLUUtaQ1E3OS4u] to register. Upon selecting a training date and completing the form, you will receive the corresponding Zoom link via email. 

We are also excited to announce that the Customer Relations team will be hosting office hours every Wednesday in August & September from 10 am to 11 am starting August 14th. If you have any questions or support needs related to the new PartnerLink feature, this time is available to you. 

Additionally, this opportunity will allow partners to interact with the Customer Relations Team, ask questions, and receive additional support regarding PartnerLink, menu items, new website features, and more. Please come prepared with questions and examples of issues that you may be experiencing with PartnerLink. Sharing your experiences is valuable, as it could help others facing similar issues. If you have specific recurring issues unique to your organization, we may need to take down your information and set up a one-on-one meeting to address them thoroughly and ensure the office hours are productive for all partners. Please note that if there are no attendees in the first 15 minutes of the office hours, we will cancel that week's session. 

To register for Customer Relations office hours, please click [here|https://capitalareafoodbank.zoom.us/zbook/partner-support/customer-relations-office-hours]. 

We appreciate your ongoing partnership, collaboration, and look forward to seeing you at one of our training sessions or during our office hours.
